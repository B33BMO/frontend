  "5, 2021. Origin and Development of NFPA 13 NFPA 13 represents the first standard published under the auspices of the NFPA Committee on Automatic Sprinklers. Originally titled Rules and Regulations of the National Board of Fire Underwriters for Sprinkler Equipments, Automatic and Open Systems, the standard has been continuously updated to keep in step with change. Full information about the NFPA actions on various changes will be found in the NFPA Proceedings. The dates of successive editions are as follows: 1896, 1899, 1902, 1905, 1907, 1908, 1912, 1913, 1915, 1916, 1917 , 1919, 1920, 1921, 1922, 1923, 1924,1925, 1926, 1927, 1928, 1929. In 1930, a separate standard was published on Class B systems. This was integrated into the 1931 edition. Further revisions were adopted in 1934, 1935, and 1936. A two-step revision was presented in the form of a progress report in 1939 and finally adopted in 1940. Further amendments were made in 1947, 1950, 1953, 1956, 1958, 1960, 1961, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1968, 1969, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1978, 1980, 1982, 1984, 1986, and 1989.

The 1991 edition incorporated an entire rewrite of the standard to make the overall format user friendly. Substantive changes were made to numerous terms, definitions, and descriptions, with additional refinements made in 1994. The centennial ( 1996) edition included a significant rework of the requirements pertaining to the application, placement, location, spacing, and use of various types of sprinklers. Other changes provided information on extended coverage sprinklers and recognized the benefits of fast-response sprinkler technology. The 1999 edition encompassed a major reorganization ofNFPA's Sprinkler Project that included the establishment of a Technical Correlating Committee on Automatic Sprinkler Systems and four new sprinkler systems technical committees, the consolidation of NFPA's sprinkler system design and installation requirements, and the implementation of numerous technical changes. The scope ofNFPA 13 was expanded to address all sprinkler system applications. The 1999 edition contained information on the installation of underground pipe from NFPA 24 and sprinkler syste",
  "changes. The scope ofNFPA 13 was expanded to address all sprinkler system applications. The 1999 edition contained information on the installation of underground pipe from NFPA 24 and sprinkler system discharge criteria for on-floor and rack storage of Class I, II, III, IV, and plastic commodities, rubber tires, baled cotton, and roll paper that were previously located in NFPA 231, 231C, 231D, 231£, and 231F. Additionally, sprinkler system information for specialized hazards from over 40 NFPA documents was either brought into NFPA 13 using NFPA's extract policy or specifically referenced. A new chapter was also added to address the structural aspects of exposed and buried system piping. A table of cross-references to previous editions and material that was in other NFPA documents was included at the end of the 1999 edition.

  "13-2 INSTALLATION OF SPRINKLER SYSTEMS Other specific changes included a new sprinkler identification marking system and the designation of sprinkler sizes by nominal K-factors. New criteria for the use of steel pipe in underground applications was added, as well as a new provision to guard against microbiologically influenced corrosion. Obstruction rules for specific sprinkler types and rules for locating sprinklers in concealed spaces were revised. New limitations were placed on the sprinkler sizes in storage applications, and criteria for the K-25 sprinkler was added. Additionally, the requirements for protecting sprinklers against seismic events also underwent significant revision. The 2002 edition of NFPA 13 underwent style formatting and technical revisions. The style formatting was completed to comply with the Manual of Style for NFPA Technical Committee Documents and to reorganize many of the requirements in NFPA 13 into unique chapters. Editorially, NFPA 13 eliminated all the exceptions and reworded them as requirements where applicable, moved the mandatory references to Chapter 2, and relocated all the definitions to Chapter 3.

  "exceptions and reworded them as requirements where applicable, moved the mandatory references to Chapter 2, and relocated all the definitions to Chapter 3. In reorganizing NFPA 13, several new chapters were created to consolidate requirements including the following: Chapter 10 contained all of the applicable requirements for underground piping including materials, installation, and acceptance testing; Chapter 11 contained design approaches including pipe schedule, density/area method, room design method, special design areas, residential sprinklers, exposure protection, and water curtains; Chapter 12 contained the design approaches for the protection of storage, including idle pallets, miscellaneous storage, storage less than 12 ft, palletized, solid pile, bin box, and shelf storage, rack storage less than 25 ft, rack storage greater than 25 ft, rubber tire, baled cotton, rolled paper, and special storage designs; and Chapter 13 contained all of the design and installation requirements from all of the various documents that have been extracted into NFPA 13.

  "s from all of the various documents that have been extracted into NFPA 13. The 2002 edition made specific technical changes to address several key issues. Three major areas of irregular ceiling were addressed, including skylights, stepped ceilings, and ceiling pockets. The design requirements for ESFR sprinklers were expanded to allow the user to choose the storage height and then the building height for any allowable arrangement. Design requirements for the protection of storage on solid shelves were added. Requirements for the installation of residential sprinklers were added that parallel the requirements for other types of sprinklers. For the 2007 edition, definitions were reorganized to place all the storage definitions in one area, and several new definitions addressing private water supply terms were added. The definitions and requirements of Ordinary Hazard Group 1 and 2 Occupancies were clarified where storage is present. The requirements for trapeze hangers were clarified and made consistent for all components, and the seismic bracing criteria were updated to ensure that NFPA 13 contains all the appropriate requirements for installation and design of seismic bracing of fi",
  "made consistent for all components, and the seismic bracing criteria were updated to ensure that NFPA 13 contains all the appropriate requirements for installation and design of seismic bracing of fire sprinkler systems. The requirements for storage were further reorganized and divided into separate chapters addressing general requirements for storage; miscellaneous storage; protection of Class I to Class IV commodities that are stored palletized, solid piled, bin boxes, or shelf storage; protection of plastic and rubber commodities that are stored palletized, solid piled, bin boxes, or shelf storage; protection of Class I through Class IV commodities that are stored on racks; protection of plastic and rubber commodities that are stored on racks; protection of rubber tire storage; protection of roll paper; and special designs of storage protection. For the 2010 edition, many of the major changes related to the requirements for storage protection. First was the combination of large drop sprinkler and the specific application control mode sprinkler requirements and the revision of the terminology to identifY them as Control Mode Specific Application sprinklers (CMSA). Next, new crit",
  "p sprinkler and the specific application control mode sprinkler requirements and the revision of the terminology to identifY them as Control Mode Specific Application sprinklers (CMSA). Next, new criteria for use of smoke vents were added to Chapter 12. The density/area curves in the storage chapters were reduced to a maximum 3000 ft2 (278 m2) operating area; this was a significant reduction of some curves that had extended up to 6000 ft2 (557 m2) . Changes to rack storage in the 2010 edition included a new method to calculate the rack shelf area. Finally, the provisions for back-to-back shelf storage were added to the storage chapters. Criteria for the protection of three new special storage arrangements were added to Chapter 20. These included protection of carton records storage with catwalk access; compact shelving of commodities consisting of paper files, magazines, books, and similar documents in folders and miscellaneous supplies with no more than 5 percent plastics up to 8 ft high; and protection of high bay record storage. In Chapter 9, several changes occurred regarding sway bracing of sprinkler systems, including the introduction of new zone of influence tables for Sched",
  "igh; and protection of high bay record storage. In Chapter 9, several changes occurred regarding sway bracing of sprinkler systems, including the introduction of new zone of influence tables for Schedule 5 steel pipe, CPVC, and Type M copper tube. Also the means for calculating the loads in the zone of influence were modified to correlate with SEI/ ASCE-7, and a new Annex E was added that described this calculation. Other areas of change included requirements for listed expansion chambers; clarification of ceiling pocket rules; and clarification of the formulas used in calculating large antifreeze systems. The 2013 edition ofNFPA 13 included changes to many technical requirements as well as the reorganization of multiple chapters. One significant change that was made to the administrative chapter ofNFPA 13 was to clarifY that watermist systems were not covered within NFPA 13 and that NFPA 750 should be used when looking for guidance on the design and installation of those systems. A series of new requirements addressed the need for a compatibility review where nonmetallic piping and fittings are installed in systems also using petroleum-based products such as cutting oils and corro",
  "ries of new requirements addressed the need for a compatibility review where nonmetallic piping and fittings are installed in systems also using petroleum-based products such as cutting oils and corrosion inhibitors. Several modifications were made to the standard pertaining to freeze protection. The use of antifreeze in new NFPA 13 sprinkler systems was prohibited unless the solution use was listed, and the listing indicated the inability for the solution to ignite. 2022 Edition",
  "ORIGIN & DEVELOPMENT Other freeze protection modifications to the standard included clarification on the use of heat tracing, required barrel length for dry sprinklers, and the allowance for engineering analyses to be submitted to support an alternate freeze protection scheme. New sprinkler omission requirements were added for elevator machine rooms and other elevator associated spaces where certain criteria were met. Chapter 9 included updated information on shared support structures as well as a revised seismic bracing calculation form. Chapters 16 and 17 were reorganized to make the chapters easier to follow, to create more consistency between the various storage chapters. A new chapter on alternative approaches for storage applications was added to provide guidance on performance-based approaches dealing with storage arrangements. One of the largest changes to the 2016 edition ofNFPA 13 was the review of all metric conversions. Historically the document had used an \"exact\" conversion process, but in the 2016 edition an approximate conversion process was used. The intent of this change was to make the document more usable outside the United States. Another major change was the i",

Another major change was the inclusion of a pipe venting requirement to eliminate as much air as possible from wet pipe systems. This requirement contemplates only a single vent in each wet system. There were a significant number of changes to the storage chapters of NFPA 13. New design criteria were included for the protection of exposed, expanded Group A plastics stored in racks. Also, a ceiling and in-rack design approach, called an \"alternative protection scheme,\" was added to Chapters 16 and 17. A similar concept had existed for sprinkler protection in NFPA 30 for several revision cycles. A new section on sprinkler design where cloud ceilings are installed was added. This design scheme allows sprinklers to be omitted above cloud ceilings when the gap between clouds (or clouds and walls) meets a maximum allowable dimension based on the floor-to-cloud ceiling height. This new language was created based on a project conducted by the Fire Protection Research Foundation. Chapter 10, which is extracted from NFPA 24,",

Chapter 10, which is extracted from NFPA 24, was significantly revised based on the rewrite ofNFPA 24. Most of the technical content remained the same, although the organization and structure were modified. 13-3 The 2019 edition ofNFPA 13 has undergone a complete reorganization and is now fashioned in order of how one would approach the design of a sprinkler system. Users will now find hazard classifications, water supplies, and underground piping at the beginning of the standard. Chapter 8 has been divided into several new chapters, breaking out general rules for sprinkler locations into one chapter and several other chapters specific to sprinkler technology. The storage chapters have also been reorganized by sprinkler technology and address ceiling-only design. Chapter 25 has been revised and now contains all the requirements for in-rack sprinklers. Requirements for vertical pipe chases have been clarified as have requirements for electrical equipment rooms where sprinklers can be omitted. Additionally, new beam rules for resi",
  "in-rack sprinklers. Requirements for vertical pipe chases have been clarified as have requirements for electrical equipment rooms where sprinklers can be omitted. Additionally, new beam rules for residential sprinklers have been added and details provided. Due to the extensive reorganization of the 2019 edition, new features were added to help users locate requirements and identifY sections with technical changes. The 2016-2019 Roadmap comparing the section numbers of the 2016 edition to the 2019 edition was compiled and is located after the index. It was provided for information only, to be used as a quick-reference locator. Technical changes from the last edition were also indicated and should be used as a guide. Shaded text identified requirements that were modified because of additions and deletions except for tables and figures. New requirements were marked with the N symbol.

The 2022 edition ofNFPA 13 has undergone a philosophical change, moving away from the use of density/area curves in favor of single point density design options for new systems. Existing systems can still use the density/area curves. Many new definitions have been added and several existing definitions were modified. Several revisions to Chapter 4 delineate miscellaneous and low-piled storage requirements. As nitrogen generators are new to NFPA 13, supplementary requirements have been added throughout the standard. Considerations associated with water flow tests have been added to Chapter 5. Supervision requirements for dry pipe systems were added to Chapter 8. Requirements were added to Chapter 9 to address the use of intermediate temperature residential and quick response sprinklers. Also, a new section on small temporarily occupied spaces was added to address conditions where pods are installed. Obstruction criteria was added for suspended or floor­mounted obstructions in ordinary hazard occupancies. Chapter 14's ESFR sp",
  "ccupied spaces was added to address conditions where pods are installed. Obstruction criteria was added for suspended or floor­mounted obstructions in ordinary hazard occupancies. Chapter 14's ESFR sprinkler location criteria were modified, and obstruction requirements were revised to align with the results of a recent Fire Protection Research Foundation report. In Chapter 16, the process for determining whether freeze protection is needed has been modified to require the use of the lowest mean temperature for 1 day, obtained for an approved source, and no longer permits the use of the isothermal map. Also, criteria were added to address the protection of piping subject to mechanical damage. Criteria on multiple-row rack depth has been added to Chapter 20, and several tables throughout the storage chapters have been revised or reconfigured. New ESFR sprinklers with K-factors of K-28 ( 400) and K-33.6 ( 480) have been added to Chapter 23. Chapter 25 has been rewritten and reorganized completely.

  "13-398 INSTALlATION OF SPRINKLER SYSTEMS Annex A Explanatory Material Annex A is not a part of the requirements of this NFPA document but is included for informational purposes only. This annex contains explan­ atory material, numbered to correspond with the applicable text para­ graphs. A.l.l This standard provides a range of sprinkler system approaches, design development alternatives, and component options that are all acceptable. Building owners and their designated representatives are advised to carefully evaluate proposed selections for appropriateness and preference. A.l.l. 2 Various codes and standards allow exceptions and reductions in building fire protection and other construction features where fire sprinkler systems are installed in accord­ance with NFPA standards. Only after appropriate analysis and evaluation of a tested mist system has been performed for the intended installation, and taking into consideration criteria other than solely fire-fighting performance (visibility, pressure ratings of backup systems, etc.) should exceptions and reduc­tions in building fire protection and other construction features be allowed by the authority having jurisdiction. These sys",
  "lity, pressure ratings of backup systems, etc.) should exceptions and reduc­tions in building fire protection and other construction features be allowed by the authority having jurisdiction. These systems are adequately described in NFPA 750. A.l.l. 3 This standard also provides guidance for the installa­tion of systems for exterior protection and specific hazards. Where these systems are installed, they are also designed for protection of a fire from a single ignition source. � A.l. 2 Since its inception, this document has been developed on the basis of standardized materials, devices, and design prac­tices. However, Sections 1.2 and 15.2 allow the use of materials and devices not specifically designated by this standard, provi­ded such use is within parameters established by a listing organ­ization. In using such materials or devices, it is important that all conditions, requirements, and limitations of the listing be fully understood and accepted and that the installation be in complete accord with such listing requirements. A.l. 6.1. 4 Where both units of measure are presented (SI and Imperial), users of this standard should apply one set of units consistently and should not al",
  "lete accord with such listing requirements. A.l. 6.1. 4 Where both units of measure are presented (SI and Imperial), users of this standard should apply one set of units consistently and should not alternate between units. A.l. 6.3 Some dimensions used in this standard require a tight precision and others do not. For example, when performing hydraulic calculations more precision is required than when specifying a nominal dimension. An example is pipe sizes, where we typically refer to a nominal diameter rather than the exact diameter. The metric equivalents also have a set of gener­ally accepted nominal measurements, and they are not a precise conversion from the \"English Unit\" nominal dimen­sion. Throughout the standard the generally accepted nominal pipe sizes have been used. For example, 1 in. pipe = 25 mm, 1 � in. pipe = 32 mm, 1 � in. pipe = 40 mm, and so forth. In other cases, rounding is used and the number of significant digits taken into account. For example, a 30 ft ceiling would be 9.144 m. This implies a level of precision that is higher than used for the original dimension, and a conversion to 9.1 m or even 9 m is more appropriate. Another example is that in the standa",
  "ould be 9.144 m. This implies a level of precision that is higher than used for the original dimension, and a conversion to 9.1 m or even 9 m is more appropriate. Another example is that in the standard, 1 in. has been converted to 25 mm and not 25.4 mm, 2 in. to 50 mm, 6 in. to 150 mm, and so forth. Finally, locally available material can have different characteristics in countries that use metric units than are typically found in the United States. Examples are things like standard door or window sizes, rack dimensions, and so forth. In these cases an approximate conversion can also be used. Where approximate conversions have been used, it is acceptable for a designer or installer to use an exact conversion rather than the approximate conver­sion used in the standard. A.3.2. 1 Approved. The National Fire Protection Association does not approve, inspect, or certify any installations, proce­dures, equipment, or materials; nor does it approve or evaluate testing laboratories. In determining the acceptability of installa­tions, procedures, equipment, or materials, the authority having jurisdiction may base acceptance on compliance with NFPA or other appropriate standards. In the abse",
  "ning the acceptability of installa­tions, procedures, equipment, or materials, the authority having jurisdiction may base acceptance on compliance with NFPA or other appropriate standards. In the absence of such standards, said authority may require evidence of proper instal­lation, procedure, or use. The authority having jurisdiction may also refer to the listings or labeling practices of an organi­zation that is concerned with product evaluations and is thus in a position to determine compliance with appropriate standards for the current production of listed items. A.3.2.2 Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) . The phrase \"authority having jurisdiction,\" or its acronym AHJ, is used in NFPA documents in a broad manner, since jurisdictions and approval agencies vary, as do their responsibilities. Where public safety is primary, the authority having jurisdiction may be a federal, state, local, or other regional department or indi­vidual such as a fire chief; fire marshal; chief of a fire preven­tion bureau, labor department, or health department; building official; electrical inspector; or others having statutory author­ity. For insurance purposes, an insurance inspection depart­ment",
  "preven­tion bureau, labor department, or health department; building official; electrical inspector; or others having statutory author­ity. For insurance purposes, an insurance inspection depart­ment, rating bureau, or other insurance company representative may be the authority having jurisdiction. In many circumstances, the property owner or his or her designa­ted agent assumes the role of the authority having jurisdiction; at government installations, the commanding officer or depart­mental official may be the authority havingjurisdiction. A.3.2.3 Listed. The means for identifying listed equipment may vary for each organization concerned with product evalua­tion; some organizations do not recognize equipment as listed unless it is also labeled. The authority having jurisdiction should utilize the system employed by the listing organization to identify a listed product. A.3.3.4 Aisle Width. See Figure A.3.3.4.

  "ANNEX A A-3-3-149 Open-Top Container- Open-top containers can prevent water from running across the top to storage and down the flues and can also collect water. The container will prevent water penetration to a fire in lower levels where it is needed. Rack or flue collapse can also occur if too much water is collec­ted. Consideration should be given to the potential degree of water collection possible within the container when applying the definition of an open-top container. The following condi­tions should be considered: (1) Small openings at the top of containers containing such items as fresh produce are quite common and should not be considered as an open-top container. (2) Arrangements that include open-top containers that are all located on the bottom tier of rack storage do not prevent penetration of water and should not be consid­ered an open-top container.

Racks can be single-, double-, or multiple-row, with or without solid shelving. The standard commodity used in most of the tests was 42 in. (1.1 m) on a side. Examples of the types of racks covered in this standard are as follows: (1) Double-Row Racks. Pallets rest on two beams parallel to the aisle. Any number of pallets can be supported by one pair of beams. [See Figure A.3.3. 1 77( a) through Figure A.3.3. 17 7( d).} (2) Automatic Storage-Type Rack. The pallet is supported by two rails running perpendicular to the aisle. [See Figure A.3.3. 17 7( e).] (3) Multiple-Row Racks More Than Two Pallets Deep, Measured Aisle to Aisle.

(1.1 m) wide. [See Figure A.3.3. 1 77(j) through Figure A.3.3. 1 77(i).] ( 4) Movable Racks. Movable racks are racks on fixed rails or guides. They can be moved back and forth only in a hori­zontal, two-dimensional plane. A moving aisle is created as abutting racks are either loaded or unloaded, then moved across the aisle to abut other racks. [See Figure A.3.3. 1 77(k).} (5) Cantilever Rack. The load is supported on arms that extend horizontally from columns. The load can rest on the arms or on shelves supported by the arms. [See Figure A.3.3. 1 77(j).} Load depth in conventional or automatic racks should be considered a nominal 4ft (1. 2 m).

Water is not required to fall on every square inch of floor space of the occupancy. This definition establishes a term that will be used to address the rules for acceptable dry spaces that occur when walls interfere with the residential sprinkler's spray pattern. Angled walls, wing walls, and slightly indented walls can disrupt water discharging from a sprinkler, which does not travel only in an absolute straight line, as if it were beams of light. Where small (typically triangu­lar) shadowed areas are formed on the floor adjacent to the wall, these shadowed areas are purely on paper and do not take into account the dynamic variables of sprinkler discharge. In order to be acceptable, the shadow area needs to be within the coverage area of a sprinkler, meaning that water would discharge to the space directly if the structural or architectural feature was not there.

(AUT­SSD) A.3.3.215.2 General Sprinkler Characteristics. The response time index (RTI) is a measure of the sensitivity of the sprinkl­er's thermal element as installed in a specific sprinkler. It is usually determined by plunging a sprinkler into a heated lami­nar airflow within a test oven. The plunge test is not currently applicable to certain sprinklers.

In most fire scenarios, sprinkler activation times will be shortest where the thermal elements are located 1 in. (25 mm) to 3 in. (75 mm) below the ceiling. A fast-response sprinkler is expected to operate quicker than a standard-response sprinkler in the same installation orienta­tion. For modeling purposes, concealed sprinklers can be considered equivalent to pendent sprinklers having a similar thermal response sensitivity installed 12 in. (300 mm) below smooth unobstructed ceilings, and recessed sprinklers can be considered equivalent to pendent sprinklers having a similar thermal response sensitivity installed 8 in.

  "Density/Area (CMDA) Sprinkler. This definition is focused on the storage application since the term CMDA is used in the storage chapters. As indicated in Chapter 20, spray sprinklers intended for storage applications requiring a design density greater than 0.34 gpm/ft (13.9 mm/ min) should have a nominal K-factor of K-11.2 (K-160) or larger and be listed for storage applications. Spray sprinklers having a nominal K-factor of K-5.6 (K-80) or K-8.0 (K-115) are permitted to be used for storage applications as a CMDA sprin­kler within certain design densities as described in Chapter 20. Spray type sprinklers intended for use in accordance with the occupancy hazard density/area curves could also be consid­ered CMDA sprinklers. However, the CMDA terminology is generally not referenced in the non-storage chapters, and this term is not used to describe these sprinklers in the product list­ings.

Generally, pipe that is 6 in. (15 0 mm) or larger can carry combined domestic/fire protection demand without any consideration for domestic demand being neces­sary. A.5. 1. 4 Evaluation of the water supply and environmental conditions does not necessarily require a water sample analysis by a laboratory. Instead, general knowledge of the long-term condition of sprinkler systems with similar piping materials in similar environments on the same water supply can be a suffi­cient evaluation. There are several options to address the effects of MIC on sprinkler systems. Some types of sprinkler pipe such as CPVC have not shown to be affected by MIC.

  "types of pipe are being manufactured with a biofilm that resists the effects of MIC. Where water supplies are treated with bacterial inhibitors, evaluation of the effects of the bacterial inhibitor on sprinkler system components (pipe, fittings, sprinklers, gaskets, valves, and seals) is just as important as evaluating the effect the bacte­rial inhibitor has on the organisms. Where water treatment is selected as the method to deal with MIC, all water entering the system during testing or flushing needs to be treated so that the organisms do not get a chance to establish themselves. Since all of the conditions that can affect the growth of MIC are unknown, a plan to sample randomly selected interior posi­tions in the system can be effective.

  "ANNEX A of the interior inspections will depend on the extent of the known MIC problem with the same water supply and similar environmental conditions. A-5-L5-2 Where the system riser is close to an outside wall, underground fittings of proper length should be used in order to avoid pipe joints located in or under the wall. Where the connection passes through the foundation wall below grade, a 1 in. to 3 in. (25 mm to 75 mm) clearance should be provided around the pipe and the clear space filled with asphalt mastic or similar flexible waterproofing material. A-5-L6 Where water meters are in the supply lines to a sprin­kler system, they should be rated to deliver the proper system demand. The amount of water supplied through a water meter varies with its size and type and might not provide the required demand, regardless of the water supply available. A-5-L7 Where connections are made from public waterworks systems, such systems should be guarded against possible contamination as follows (see A WWA M14, Recommended Practice for Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control): (1) For private fire service mains with direct connections from public waterworks mains only or with boost",

Where connections are made from public waterworks systems, it might be necessary to guard against possible contam­ination of the public supply. A.5.2.1 Acceptable water supplies for fire sprinkler systems must provide sufficient flow and pressure for the required duration. Many water supply sources contain sufficient flow and volume but do not possess sufficient pressure.

Fire pumps are used with other supplies such as water­works or gravity tanks to provide additional pressure needed to meet the system demand. A.5.2.1 (7) In an effort to help comply with efforts for sustaina­ble and renewable building construction, some engineers and 13-413 architects have suggested the use of reclaimed or recycled water to use in fire sprinkler systems rather than the potable water typically used from the public water supply. While this effort has some merit, there is a concern about the quality of the water from these recycled and reclaimed systems. The capture of rainwater is generally not considered a problem since NFPA 13 has long allowed the use of open lakes, rivers, and ponds, which are nothing more than open collections of rainwater and melted snow. But other systems that are recycling water that has been used in some industrial or other process might have contaminants that are combustible, or they might be detrimental to the sprinkler system by preventing it from working properly or accelerating corrosion.

  "e contaminants that are combustible, or they might be detrimental to the sprinkler system by preventing it from working properly or accelerating corrosion. Recycled or reclaimed water should never be used in a sprinkler system until an analysis of what contaminants might be in the water has determined that nothing will be detrimental to sprinkler system performance or the expected reasonable life of the sprinkler system. When such an analysis is completed success­fully, the information should be transmitted to the sprinkler contractor through the use of the Owner's Certificate required by Section 4.2. A.5.2.2 Care should be taken in making water tests to be used in designing or evaluating the capability of sprinkler systems. The water supply tested should be representative of the supply that might be available at the time of a fire. For example, test­ing of public water supplies should be done at times of normal demand on the system. Public water supplies are likely to fluc­tuate widely from season to season and even within a 24-hour period. Allowance should be made for seasonal or daily fluctua­tions, for drought conditions, for possibility of interruption by flood, or for ice con",
  "y from season to season and even within a 24-hour period. Allowance should be made for seasonal or daily fluctua­tions, for drought conditions, for possibility of interruption by flood, or for ice conditions in winter. Testing of water supplies also normally used for industrial use should be done while water is being drawn for industrial use. The range of industrial­use demand should be taken into account. In special situations where the domestic water demand could significantly reduce the sprinkler water supply, an increase in the size of the pipe supplying both the domestic and sprinkler water can be justi­fied. Future changes in water supplies should be considered. For example, a large, established, urban supply is not likely to change greatly within a few years. However, the supply in a growing suburban industrial park might deteriorate quite rapidly as greater numbers of plants draw more water. Dead-end mains should be avoided, if possible, by arranging for mains supplied from both directions. When private fire service mains are connected to dead-end public mains, each situation should be examined to determine if it is practical to request the water utility to loop the mains i",

TestingofWaterSuppl y. To determine the value of public water as a supply for automatic sprinkler systems, it is generally neces­sary to make a flow test to determine how much water can be discharged at a residual pressure at a rate sufficient to give the required residual pressure under the roof (with the volume flow hydraulically translated to the base of the riser) - that is, a pressure head represented by the height of the building plus the required residual pressure. The proper method of conducting this test is to use two hydrants in the vicinity of the property. The static pressure should be measured on the hydrant in front of or nearest to the property and the water allowed to flow from the hydrant next nearest the property, preferably the one farthest from the Shaded text = Revisions. .0. = Text deletions and figure/table revisions. • = Section deletions.

Referring to Figure A.5.2.2, the method of conducting the flow tests is as follows: (l) Attach the gauge to the hydrant (A) and obtain static pressure. (2) Either attach a second gauge to the hydrant (B) or use the pitot tube at the outlet. Have hydrant (B) opened wide and read pressure at both hydrants. (3) Use the pressure at (B) to compute the gallons flowing and read the gauge on (A) to determine the residual pres­sure or that which will be available on the top line of sprinklers in the property. Water pressure in pounds per square inch for a given height in feet equals height multiplied by 0.433.

[24:Figure A. 10A.3 .2.1] ANNEX A A.6.5. 1.1 While the use of the underground fire protection piping as the grounding electrode for the building is prohibi­ted, NFPA 70 requires that all metallic piping systems be bonded and grounded to disperse stray electrical currents. Therefore, the fire protection piping will be bonded to other metallic systems and grounded, but the electrical system will need an additional ground for its operation. [24:A.l0.5.1.1] A.6.6 It is a fundamental design principle of fluid mechanics that dynamic and static pressures, acting at changes in size or direction of a pipe, produce unbalanced thrust forces at loca­tions such as bends, tees, wyes, dead ends, and reducer offsets. This design principle includes consideration of lateral soil pres­sure and pipe/soil friction, variables that can be reliably deter­mined using current soil engineering knowledge. Refer to A.6.6.2 for a list of references for use in calculating and deter­mining joint restraint systems. Section 6.6 does not mandate which method of restraint should be used.

  "use in calculating and deter­mining joint restraint systems. Section 6.6 does not mandate which method of restraint should be used. This decision is left to the design professional or the owner. Except for the case of welded joints and approved special restrained joints, such as is provided by approved mechanical joint retainer glands or locked mechanical and push-on joints, the usual joints for underground pipe are expected to be held in place by the soil in which the pipe is buried. Gasketed push­on and mechanical joints without special locking devices have limited ability to resist separation due to movement of the pipe. [24:A.l0.6] A.6.6.1 The use of concrete thrust blocks is one method of restraint, provided that stable soil conditions prevail and space requirements permit placement. Successful blocking is depend­ent on factors such as location, availability and placement of concrete, and possibility of disturbance by future excavations. Resistance is provided by transferring the thrust force to the soil through the larger bearing area of the block so that the resultant pressure against the soil does not exceed the horizon­tal bearing strength of the soil. The design of thrust",
  "thrust force to the soil through the larger bearing area of the block so that the resultant pressure against the soil does not exceed the horizon­tal bearing strength of the soil. The design of thrust blocks consists of determining the appropriate bearing area of the block for a particular set of conditions. The parameters involved in the design include pipe size, design pressure, angle of the bend (or configuration of the fitting involved), and the horizontal bearing strength of the soil. Table A.6.6.1 (a) gives the nominal thrust at fittings for vari­ous sizes of ductile-iron and PVC piping. Figure A.6.6.1 (a) shows an example of how thrust forces act on a piping bend. Thrust blocks are generally categorized into two groups -bearing and gravity blocks. Figure A.6.6.1 (b) depicts a typical bearing thrust block on a horizontal bend. [24:A.l0.6.1] 13-419 The following are general criteria for bearing block design: (1) The bearing surface should, where possible, be placed against undisturbed soil. (2) Where it is not possible to place the bearing surface against undisturbed soil, the fill between the bearing surface and undisturbed soil must be compacted to at least 90 percent Standa",
  "rbed soil. (2) Where it is not possible to place the bearing surface against undisturbed soil, the fill between the bearing surface and undisturbed soil must be compacted to at least 90 percent Standard Proctor density. (3) Block height (h) should be equal to or less than one-half the total depth to the bottom of the block (H,) but not less than the pipe diameter (D). ( 4) Block height (h) should be chosen such that the calcula­ted block width (b) varies between one and two times the height. (5) Gravity thrust blocks can be used to resist thrust at vertical down bends. In a gravity thrust block, the weight of the block is the force providing equilibrium with the thrust force. The design problem is then to calculate the required volume of the thrust block of a known density. The vertical component of the thrust force in Figure A.6.6.1 (c) is balanced by the weight of the block. For required horizontal bearing block areas, see Table A.6.6. l( b). The required block area (Ab) is as follows: where: Ab = required block area (ft2) h = block height (ft) b = calculated block width (ft) T = thrust force (lbf) sf = safety factor (usually 1.5) sb = bearing strength (lb/ft2) [A.6. 6.1a ] Then,",

Typical values for conservative horizontal bearing strengths of various soil types are listed in Table A.6.6. 1 (c) . [24:A.l0.6.1] In lieu of the values for soil bearing strength shown in Table A.6.6.l( c), a designer might choose to use calculated Rankine passive pressure (Ij,) or other determination of soil-bearing strength based on actual soil properties.

Analysis of this aspect follows the same principles as the previ­ous section on bearing blocks. [24:A.1 0.6.1] A.6.6.2 A method for providing thrust restraint is the use of restrained joints.

  "function in a manner similar to thrust blocks, insofar as the reaction of the entire restrained unit of piping with the soil balances the thrust forces. The objective in designing a restrained joint thrust restraint system is to determine the length of pipe that must be restrained on each side of the focus of the thrust force, which occurs at a change in direction. This will be a function of the pipe size, the internal pressure, the depth of cover, and the characteristics of the solid surrounding the pipe. The manufac­turer's installation instructions should be referenced to deter­mine the distance from each change in direction that joints should be restrained.

  "cessible aboveground flushing outlets allowing the water to run until clear. Figure A.6.10.2.1 shows acceptable examples of flushing the system. If water is supplied from more than one source or from a looped system, divisional valves should be closed to produce a high-velocity flow through each single line. The flows specified in Table 6.10.2. 1.3 will produce a velocity of at least 10 ft/sec (3.0 m/ sec), which is necessary for cleaning the pipe and for lifting foreign material to an aboveground flushing outlet. [24:A.l0.10 .2.1] A.6. 10.2. 1.3 The velocity of approximately 10 ft/sec (3.0 m/ sec) was used to develop Table 6.10.2. 1.3 because this velocity has been shown to be sufficient for moving obstructive material out of the pipes. It is not important that the velocity equal exactly 10 ft/sec (3.0 m/sec), so there is no reason to increase the flow during the test for slightly different internal pipe dimensions. Note that where underground pipe serves as suction pipe for a fire pump, NFPA 20 requires greater flows for flushing the pipe.

To reduce the possibility of serious water damage in case of a break, pressure can be introduced by a small pump, the main controlling gate meanwhile being kept shut during the test. Polybutylene pipe will undergo expansion during initial pressurization. In this case, a reduction in gauge pressure might not necessarily indicate a leak.

  "13-424 INSTALlATION OF SPRINKLER SYSTEMS A recommended test procedure is as follows: The water pres­sure is to be increased in 50 psi (3.5 bar) increments until the test pressure described in 6.10 .2.2.1 is attained. Mter each increase in pressure, observations are to be made of the stabil­ity of the joints. These observations are to include such items as protrusion or extrusion of the gasket, leakage, or other factors likely to affect the continued use of a pipe in service. During the test, the pressure is not to be increased by the next incre­ment until the joint has become stable. This applies particu­larly to movement of the gasket. Mter the pressure has been increased to the required maximum value, it is held for 2 hours while observations are made for leakage and the pressure read­ings are checked. [24:A.10. 10.2. 2.1] A-6-10-2-2-4 Hydrostatic tests should be made before the joints are covered, so that any leaks can be detected. Thrust blocks should be sufficiently hardened before hydrostatic test­ing is begun. If the joints are covered with backfill prior to test­ing, the contractor remains responsible for locating and correcting any leakage in excess of that permitted. [24:",
  "e hydrostatic test­ing is begun. If the joints are covered with backfill prior to test­ing, the contractor remains responsible for locating and correcting any leakage in excess of that permitted. [24:A.1 0.10.2.2.4] A-6-10-2-2-6 One acceptable means of completing this test is to utilize a pressure pump that draws its water supply from a full container. At the completion of the 2-hour test, the amount of water to refill the container can be measured to determine the amount of makeup water. In order to minimize pressure loss, the piping should be flushed to remove any trapped air. Additionally, the piping could be pressurized prior to the hydrostatic test to account for expansion, absorption, entrap­ped air, and so on. The use of a blind flange or skillet is preferred for hydrostat­ically testing segments of new work. Metal-seated valves are susceptible to developing slight imperfections during trans­port, installation, and operation and thus can be likely to leak more than 1 fl oz/in. (1.2 mL/mm) of valve diameter per hour. For this reason, the blind flange should be used when hydrostatically testing.

At the plan review stage, the sprinkler identification number should be checked against such a data­base or the manufacturer's literature to ensure that sprinklers are being used properly and within the limitations of their list­ings. Field inspections can include spot checks to ensure that the model numbers on the plans are those actually installed. A.7.2.2.1 See Table A.7.2.2 .l.

While these products can offer advantages, such as ease of handling and installation, cost-effectiveness, reduction of friction losses, and improved corrosion resistance, it is important to recognize that they also have limitations that are to be considered by those contemplating their use or accept­ance. With respect to thermoplastic pipe and fittings, exposure of such piping to elevated temperatures in excess of that for which it has been listed can result in distortion or failure. Accordingly, care must be exercised when locating such systems to ensure that the ambient temperature, including seasonal variations, does not exceed the rated value.

  "discharge might not occur simulta­neously with the rise in ambient temperature and, under some circumstances, can be delayed for periods beyond the toler­ance of the piping, protection in the form of a fire-resistant membrane is generally required. (Some listings do provide for the use of exposed piping in conjunction with residential or quick-response sprinklers, but only under specific, limited installation criteria.) Where protection is required, it is described in the listing information for each individual product, and the requirements given must be followed. It is equally important that such protection must be maintained. Removal of, for example, one or more panels in a lay-in ceiling can expose piping in the concealed space to the possibility of failure in the event of a fire. Similarly, the relocation of openings through protective ceilings that expose the pipe to heat, inconsistent with the list­ing, would place the system in jeopardy. The potential for loss of the protective membrane under earthquake conditions should also be considered.

While the listings of thermoplastic piping do not prohibit its installation in combustible concealed spaces where the provi­sion of sprinkler protection is not required, and while the stat­istical record of fire originating in such spaces is low, it should be recognized that the occurrence of a fire in such a space could result in failure of the piping system. The investigation of pipe and tube other than described in Table 7.3. 1.1 should involve consideration of many factors, including the following: (1) Pressure rating (2) Beam strength (hangers) (3) Unsupported vertical stability (4) Movement during sprinkler operation (affecting water distribution) (5) Corrosion (internal and external), chemical and electro­lytic (6) Resistance to failure when exposed to elevated tempera­tures (7) Methods of joining (strength, permanence, fire hazard) (8) Physical characteristics related to integrity during earth-quakes A.7.3.3 Other types of pipe and tube that have been investiga­ted and listed for sprinkler applications include lightweight steel pipe.

Corrosion studies have shown that, in comparison to Sched­ule 40 pipe, the effective life of lightweight steel pipe can be reduced, the level of reduction being related to its wall thick­ness.

A.7.5.2.4.1 Partial penetration welds on outlet fitting connec­tions are considered adequate, since there is no significant load on the joint other than that caused by pressure internal to the pipe (see Figure A. 7.5.2.4.1). A.7.5.2.4.2 The load due to the internal pressure can be accommodated with a weld that has a conservative weld throat thickness that can be calculated as follows: where: [A. 7 .5.2.4.2] Weld throat thickness (in.) = PD x 0.000035 P = rated system gauge pressure (psi) D = outside diameter (OD) of fitting (in.) For example, if you assume a gauge pressure of 300 psi (21 bar) and the OD of the outlet fitting of 3 in. (75 mm), the result of the thickness calculation is 0.0315 in. (0.8 mm).

A.8.LL2 Pressure gauges installed on both sides of a check valve are necessary for several reasons. They can quickly indi­cate an abnormal condition such as a closed valve or an inoper­able check valve. If the pressure on the downstream side of a check valve is less than the pressure on the upstream side, either the pressure gauges are faulty or the check valve is inop­erable. If the pressure on the upstream side of a check valve is less than the pressure on the downstream side, the pressure is trapped indicating a higher than normal pressure. This errone­ous pressure will then be part of a main drain test.

A.8.2 A dry pipe system should be installed only where heat is not adequate to prevent freezing of water in all parts of, or in sections of, the system. Dry pipe systems should be converted to wet pipe systems when they become unnecessary because adequate heat is provided. Sprinklers should not be shut off in cold weather. Where two or more dry pipe valves are used, systems prefera­bly should be divided horizontally to prevent simultaneous operation of more than one system and the resultant increased time delay in filling systems and discharging water and to prevent receipt of more than one waterflow alarm signal. Where adequate heat is present in sections of the dry pipe system, consideration should be given to dividing the system into a separate wet pipe system and dry pipe system. Minimized use of dry pipe systems is desirable where speed of operation is of particular concern.

The amount of air in the expansion chamber will not change over time. The pressure, temperature, and volume of the air at different times will be related in accord­ance with this formula: [A.8.6.3.2c] The antifreeze in the system is essentially incompressible, so the air volume in the expansion chamber will decrease by an amount equal to the expansion of the antifreeze. It is assumed that there is no trapped air in the system piping, so the only air in the system is in the expansion cham­ber. This is a conservative assumption, since more air is better. In reality, there will be at least some trapped air. However, only 13-433 the air in the expansion chamber can be relied upon to be available when needed.

In these cases, expansion of the antifreeze solution during warm weather will cause the antifreeze system to exceed the maximum working pressure, regardless of the size of the expansion chamber. The normal static pressure is too close to the maximum working pressure if the preceding formula for lt;x yields a negative result. If this occurs, use a dry pipe system instead or install a pressure-reducing valve before the backflow preventer.

  "13-434 INSTALlATION OF SPRINKLER SYSTEMS below 32°F (0°C) . Conditions are particularly favorable to condensation where pipes enter cold rooms from rooms having temperatures above freezing. Whenever the opportunity offers, fittings such as those speci­fied in 8.8.2. 1, as well as flushing connections, should be provi­ded in existing systems. Where possible, risers should be located in stair towers or other locations outside of refrigerated areas, which would reduce the probabilities of ice or frost formation within the riser (supply) pipe. Cross mains should be connected to risers or feed mains with flanges. In general, flanged fittings should be installed at points that would allow easy dismantling of the system. Split ring or other easily removable types of hangers will facilitate the dismantling. Because it is not practical to allow water to flow into sprin­kler piping in spaces that might be constantly subject to freez­ing, or where temperatures must be maintained at or below 40°F ( 4.4 oq, it is important that means be provided at the time of system installation to conduct trip tests on dry pipe valves that service such systems.

NFPA 25 contains requirements in this matter. A-8-8-2 The requirements in 8.8.2 are intended to minimize the chances of ice plug formation inside sprinkler system piping protecting freezers. A.8.8 .2.1.1 It is not the intent of this section to apply to a dry sprinkler. An additional pipe is not needed when a dry sprin­kler penetrates a refrigerated space. A.8.8.2.4 A higher degree of preventing the formation of ice blocks can be achieved by lowering the moisture of the air supply entering the refrigerated space to a pressure dew point no greater than 20°F ( -6.6°C) below the lowest nominal temperature of the refrigerated space. The pressure dew point of the air supply can cause moisture to condense and freeze in sprinkler pipe even when the air supply is from the freezer. One method of reducing the moisture content of the air by use of air drying systems is illustrated in Figure A.8.8.2.4.

Application of these factors could necessitate the use of increased air pressures and a larger air compressor. The compressed air supply should be properly prepared prior to entering a regenerative-type air dryer, such as mini­mum air pressure, maximum inlet air temperature, and proper filtration of compressed air. A.8.8 .2.5 A major factor contributing to the introduction of moisture into the system piping is excessive air compressor operation caused by system leakage. Where excessive compres­sor operation is noted or ice accumulates in the air supply piping, the system should be checked for leakage and appropri­ate corrective action should be taken.

A.8.8 .2.7.1 The dual lines feeding the system air entering the cold area are intended to facilitate continued service of the system when one line is removed for inspection. It should be noted that, when using a system as described in Figure A.8.8.2 .4, differences in the pressures at gauge P1 and gauge P2 indicate blockage in the air supply line or other malfunctions. A.8.8 .2.8 .1.1 While it is the intent to require the detection system to operate prior to sprinklers, it is possible that in some fire scenarios the sprinklers could operate prior to the detec­tion system. In general, the detection system, at its installed location and spacing, should be more sensitive to fire than the sprinklers.

Where buildings or portions of buildings are of combustible construction or contain combustible material, standard fire barriers should be provided to separate the areas that are sprin­kler protected from adjoining unsprinklered areas. All open­ings should be protected in accordance with applicable standards, and no sprinkler piping should be placed in an unsprinklered area unless the area is permitted to be unsprin­klered by this standard. Water supplies for partial systems should be designed with consideration to the fact that in a partial system more sprin­klers might be opened in a fire that originates in an unprotec­ted area and spreads to the sprinklered area than would be the case in a completely protected building.

Portable wardrobe units, such as those typically used in nurs­ing homes and mounted to the wall, do not require sprinklers to be installed in them.

Ideally, the sprinklers should be located near the side of the pit below the elevator doors, where most debris accumulates. However, care should be taken that the sprinkler location does not interfere with the elevator toe guard, which extends below the face of the door opening.

This shutdown can be accomplished by a detection system with sufficient sensitivity that operates prior to the activation of the sprinklers (see also NFPA 72 or other approved fire alarm code). As an alternative, the system can be arranged using devices or sprinklers capable of effecting power shutdown immediately upon sprinkler activation, such as a waterflow switch without a time delay. This alternative arrangement is intended to inter­rupt power before significant sprinkler discharge.

Wet sprinkler systems are preferred. However, water-filled piping exposed to heat within an oven or furnace can incur deposition and buildup of minerals within the pipe. If the oven or furnace could be exposed to freezing temperatures, dry pendent sprinklers are an alternative to wet pipe systems. Another option is to use a dry pipe system. The preferred arrangement for piping is outside of the oven; the sprinkler should be installed in the pendent position.

The insulation needs to be installed in each pocket (not just above the sprin­kler) and attached to the ceiling/roof in such a manner that it will not fall out during a fire prior to sprinkler activation. A.9.5A. l. 4 The rules describing the maximum distance permitted for sprinklers below ceilings must be followed. The concept of placing a small \"heat collector\" above a sprinkler to assist in activation is not appropriate, nor is it contemplated in this standard. There is evidence that objects above a sprinkler will delay the activation of the sprinkler where fires are not directly below the sprinkler (but are still in the coverage area of the sprinkler). One of the objectives of the standard is to cool the ceiling near the structural members with spray from a nearby sprinkler, which is not accomplished by a sprinkler far down from the ceiling, and a heat collector will not help this situation. � A.9.5.5.1 See Figure A.9.5.5.1 for a representation of a typical spray sprinkler pattern.

The general rules known as the Three Times Rule and the Four Times Rule define shadow areas that are acceptable behind obstructions like columns and walls. Tests have shown that the larger the column, the larger the shadow area behind the column will be and the longer it will take for sprinklers on the other side of the column to react to the fire behind the column.

The third best option is the sidewall sprinkler on the same wall as the cabinets on a soffit flush with the face of the cabinet. The last option should be putting sprinklers on the wall back behind the face of the cabi­net because this location is subject to being blocked by items placed on top of the cabinets. It is not the intent of the committee to require sprinklers under kitchen cabinets. � A.12 .1.11. 2.1.3 The rules of 12.1.11. 2.1.3 (known as the Four Times Rule) have been written to apply to obstructions where the sprinkler can be expected to get water to both sides of the obstruction without allowing a significant shadow area on the other side of the obstruction.

A.13.2. 6.1 It is important that sprinklers in the immediate vicinity of the fire center not skip, and this requirement impo­ses certain restrictions on the spacing. A.13.2. 7.1 If all other factors are held constant, the operating time of the first sprinkler will vary exponentially with the distance between the ceiling and deflector. At distances greater than 7 in. (17 5 mm), for other than open wood joist construc­tion, the delayed operating time will permit the fire to gain headway, with the result that substantially more sprinklers oper­ate. At distances less than 7 in. (17 5 mm), other effects occur. Changes in distribution, penetration, and cooling nullifY the advantage gained by faster operation.

For open wood joist construction, the optimum clearance between deflectors and the bottom of joists is 3!;2 in. (90 mm). A-13-2-8 To a great extent, CMSA sprinklers rely on direct attack to gain rapid control of both the burning fuel and ceil­ing temperatures.

  ".1 Examples of solid structural members are beams, stem, and so forth. A.l4.2. 11 The obstruction rules of 14.2. 11 have been primar­ily written to address horizontal obstructions like ducts and lights where the sprinkler needs to spray under the obstruction or get water both over and under the obstruction. For vertical obstruction situations like columns where the water needs to get to two sides of the obstruction, the guidance in 14.2. 11 to keep the sprinklers at least 12 in. (300 mm) from obstructions up to 12 in. (300 mm) wide and to keep the sprinkler 24 in. (600 mm) from obstructions over 12 in. (300 mm) to 24 in. (600 mm) wide can be used. For obstructions like columns that are more than 24 in. (600 mm) wide, a sprinkler should be placed on the opposite side of the obstruction while following the minimum and maximum spacing requirements of 14.2.8. A.l4.2. 11. 2 Isolated obstructions that block adjacent sprin­klers in a similar manner should be treated as a continuous obstruction.

Examples include obstructions such as light fixtures and unit heaters. N A.l4.2. 11 .2( 8) Examples of high-piled storage are rack struc­tures and solid-piled storage. A.l4.2. 11 .3.4 For example, a 1 in. (25 mm) diameter conduit would need to be 3 in. (75 mm) from the nearest pipe or conduit to be considered as an individual obstruction. Other­wise, the pipes and/or conduits would be considered as a group when applying the obstruction criteria in 14.2.11. 3.1.

Where higher wind velocity is expected, longer exposed barrel lengths will help avoid freezing of the wet piping. The total length of the barrel of the dry sprinkler must be longer than the values shown in Table 15.3.1 (a) and Table 15.3.1 (b) because the length shown in the tables is the minimum length of the barrel that needs to be exposed to the warmer ambient temperature in the heated space.

A-16-7 A manual or automatic air venting valve can be a reasonable approach on wet pipe sprinkler systems to reduce corrosion activity. The purpose of the air venting valve is to exhaust as much trapped air as possible from a single location every time the system is filled. The objective of venting is to reduce the amount of oxygen trapped in the system that will fuel corrosion and microbial activity. It is neither the intent nor practical to exhaust all trapped air from a single location on a wet pipe sprinkler system; however, more than one vent can be used on a system at the designer's discretion. Interconnection of branch line piping for venting purposes is not necessary. An inspector's test valve can serve this purpose. The air venting valve should be located where it will be most effective.

In order to effectively accomplish venting, it is necessary to choose a location where the greatest volume of trapped air is vented during the first fill and each subsequent drain and fill event. The vent connection to the system should be located off the top of horizontal piping at a high point in the system; however, the vent connection can also be effectively located off the side of a riser or riser nipple at a high point in the system. Manual air venting valves should be accessible. The manual air venting valve should be located at an accessible point and preferably not over 7f t (2.1 m) above the floor. Automatic air valves are not required to comply with the accessibility require­ment of manual air venting valves; however, it is recommended the designer locate automatic air vents over areas without ceil­ings, above a lay-in ceiling, or above an access panel.

A.l7 .3 Table 17.3.1 (a) assumes that the load from 15 ft (5 m) of water-filled pipe, plus 250 lb (ll 5 kg), is located at the midpoint of the span of the trapeze member, with a maximum allowable bending stress of 15 ksi (103 MPa). If the load is applied at other than the midpoint, for the purpose of sizing the trapeze member, an equivalent length of trapeze can be used, derived from the following formula: where: L = equivalent length 4ab L= -­ a+b a = distance from one support to the load b = distance from the other support to the load Where multiple mains are to be supported or multiple trapeze hangers are provided in parallel, the required or availa­ble section modulus can be added.

Also, special conditions such as collateral and concentrated load limits, type or method of attachment to the structural compo­nents, or location of attachment to the structural components might need to be observed when hanging system piping in pre­engineered metal buildings or buildings using other specialty structural components such as composite wood joists or combi­nation wood and tubular metal joists. The building structure is only required to handle the weight of the water-filled pipe and components, while the hangers are required to handle 5 times the weight of the water-filled pipe. In addition, a safety factor load of 250 lb (ll 5 kg) is added in both cases. The difference in requirements has to do with the different ways that loads are calculated and safety factors are applied.

Examples of common applications include headers and hori­zontal runs of pipe that need support from the floor. A.17 .5.3. 1 When a pipe stand does not resist lateral (e.g., earthquake or wind) forces, its maximum height and the weight of pipe it can support are based primarily on a limiting slenderness ratio (Kl/r), and on the axial and bending stresses caused by the vertical load applied at a specified eccentricity. The pipe stand heights presented in Table 17.5.3. 1 (a) and Table 17.5.3.1 (b) have been calculated using a \"K\" of 2.1 (i.e., assuming the pipe stand is an individual cantilever column) and a slenderness ratio limit of 300, except w",

(300 mm) controls the design. In these cases, the pipe stand height is reduced such that the allowable axial stress (Fa) is sufficient to limit the combined axial stress ratio (jj F;, i.e., actual axial stress divided by allowable axial stress) plus the bending stress ratio (/&/ Fb, i.e., actual bending stress divided by allowable bending stress) to 1.0. Two cases are considered: a vertical load at a 12 in. (300 mm) eccentricity equals a) 5 times the weight of the water-filled pipe plus 250 lb (11 5 kg) using a bending stress allowable of 28,000 psi (193 MPa), and b) the weight of the water-filled pipe plus 250 lb (11 5 kg) using a bending stress allowable of 15,000 psi (103 MPa).

  "it was imposed. When an engineering analysis is conducted, different pipe stand heights could be calculated if other assumptions are warranted based on actual conditions. For example, K=l.O can be used if the pipe at the top of the pipe stand is braced in both horizontal directions, or a shorter cantilever column could be used to limit drift. Pipe stands are intended to be a single piece of pipe. For lengths that require joining pipes, the pipes should be welded to ensure that strength is maintained. A single threaded fitting at the top of the pipe stand should be allowed for height adjust­ment in the field. (See Figure A.l7 .5.3. 1.) A.17 .5.3.2 These short pipe stands commonly support items such as backflow preventers, header piping, and other appurte­nances. A.17 .5.3.2(2) The allowances for these short pipe stands do not account for eccentric loadings. See Figure A.17.5.3.2 (2) . A.17 .5.4.2 Where welded steel flanges are used for the base plate, the entire circumference of the flange should be welded.

Water surges could be from filling the system, from system operation, or water supply related. A.17 .5.6.2 Traditionally, pipe saddles have been used, which creates a \"U\" for the pipe to rest in. However, thrust forces in some applications can be large enough to move the pipe off the saddle. Therefore, a pipe ring or clamps should be around the system piping to keep it in place. � A.18.1 Sprinkler systems are protected against earthquake damage by means of the following: (1) Stresses that would develop in the piping due to differen­tial building movement are minimized using flexible joints or clearances.

Based on the project location, local codes and requirements will be applied. For projects using metric units, it is likely that the enforced codes, standards, and guidelines will vary compared to those used to create the simplified approaches to seismic protection in Chapter 18. These variations could include strength design of components instead of the allowable stress design (ASD) of components, such as concrete anchors, tested by way of meth­ods other than those listed in ACI 355.2, Qualification of Post­ Installed Mechanical Anchors in Concrete and Commentary. Therefore, metric units have been included where practicable. In such situations, it is recommended to consult local require­ments, authorities, and products to determine whether compo­nents are adequate for the seismic loads, including appropriate safety factors.

Currently, there are no structural requirements in ASCE/SEI 7, Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures, for the clouds to be seis­mically braced. Unbraced cloud ceilings in higher seismic areas could easily displace during design earthquakes half the suspension length or more. One solution might be to use flexi­ble sprinkler hose with the bracket connected to the cloud so that the sprinkler will move with the cloud during seismic motion, provided the ceiling system is constructed per ASTM C635/C635M, Standard Specification for Manufacture, Performance, and Testing of Metal Suspension Systems for Acoustical Tile and Lay- Shaded text = Revisions. .0. = Text deletions and figure/table revisions. • = Section deletions.

  "anticipated movement. A.18 .2 Strains on sprinkler piping can be greatly lessened and, in many cases, damage prevented by increasing the flexibility between major parts of the sprinkler system. One part of the piping should never be held rigidly and another part allowed to move freely without provision for relieving the strain. Flexi­bility can be provided by using listed flexible couplings, by join­ing grooved end pipe at critical points, and by allowing clearances at walls and floors. Tank or pump risers should be treated the same as sprinkler risers for their portion within a building. The discharge pipe of tanks on buildings should have a control valve above the roof line so any pipe break within the building can be controlled. Piping 2 in. (50 mm) or smaller in size is pliable enough so that flexible couplings are not usually necessary. \"Rigid-type\" couplings that permit less than 1 degree of angular movement at the grooved connections are not considered to be flexible couplings.

Therefore, determining an allowable horizontal load using the factors in Table 18.5.2.3 and a listed load rating established solely by test­ing along the brace assembly at 90 degrees might not be conservative.

  "determining the spacing of lateral earthquake braces in straight runs of pipe: (1) deflection and (2) stress. Both deflection and stress tend to increase with the spacing of the braces. The larger the midspan deflection, the greater the chance of impact with adjacent structural/nonstructural components. The higher the stress in the pipe, the greater the chance of rupture in the pipe or coupling. Braces are spaced to limit the stresses in the pipe and fittings to the levels permitted in modern building codes, with an upper limit of 40 ft (12.2 m). The braces also serve to control deflection of the pipe under earthquake loads. In the longitudinal direction, there is no deflection consideration, but the pipe must transfer the load to the longitudinal braces with­out inducing large axial stresses in the pipe and the couplings. A.18.5.5.2 The sway brace spacings in Table 18.5.5.2 (a) through Table 18.5.5.2 (m) were developed to allow designers to continue to use familiar concepts, such as zone of influence, to lay out and proportion braces while ensuring compatibility with modern seismic requirements.

  "13-482 INSTALlATION OF SPRINKLER SYSTEMS A-18-5-9 Location of Sway Bracing. Two-way braces are either longitudinal or lateral, depending on their orientation with the axis of the piping. [See Figure A. 18.5. 9(a), Figure A. 18.5. 9(b), Figure A. 18.5. 9(c), and Figure A.18 .5. 9(d).} The simplest form of two-way brace is a piece of steel pipe or angle. Because the brace must act in both compression and tension, it is necessary to size the brace to prevent buckling. An important aspect of sway bracing is its location. In Build­ing 1 of Figure A.18.5.9(a), the relatively heavy main will pull on the branch lines when shaking occurs. If the branch lines are held rigidly to the roof or floor above, the fittings can frac­ture due to the induced stresses. In selecting brace locations, one must consider both the design load on the brace, as well as the ability of the pipe to span between brace locations. Bracing should be on the main as indicated at Location B of Figure A.18.5.9(a) . With shaking in the direction of the arrows, the light branch lines will be held at the fittings. Where neces­sary, a lateral brace or other restraint should be installed to prevent a branch line from striking",
  "ing in the direction of the arrows, the light branch lines will be held at the fittings. Where neces­sary, a lateral brace or other restraint should be installed to prevent a branch line from striking against building compo­nents or equipment. A four-way brace is indicated at Location A of Figure A.18.5.9 (a). This keeps the riser and main lined up and also prevents the main from shifting. In Building 1 of Figure A.18.5.9(a) , the branch lines are flex­ible in a direction parallel to the main, regardless of building movement. The heavy main cannot shift under the roof or floor, and it also steadies the branch lines. While the main is braced, the flexible couplings on the riser allow the sprinkler system to move with the floor or roof above, relative to the floor below. Figure A.18.5.9(b) , Figure A.18.5.9(c) , and Figure A.18.5.9(d) show typical locations of sway bracing.

This is needed by the designer to verify that the piping can span between brace points. For the purposes of this example, assume that Cp = 0.5. (2) Based on the distance of system piping from the struc­tural members that will support the braces, choose brace shapes and sizes from Table 18.5. 11. 8(a) through Table 18.5. 11. 8(£) such that the maximum slenderness ratios, l/ r, do not exceed 300. The angle of the braces from the vertical should be at least 30 degrees and preferably 45 degrees or more. (3) Tentatively space lateral braces at 40 ft (12 m) maximum distances along system piping, and tentatively space longi­tudinal braces at 80 ft (24 m) maximum distances along system piping. Lateral braces should meet the piping at right angles, and longitudinal braces should be aligned with the piping.

A.18. 5.11.1 Sway brace design and installation is critical to performance and requires attention to detail. Sway brace design parameters are dynamic and interdependent. Accord­ingly, seismic force is influenced by geography, brace location is impacted by system design, and brace geometry is relative to the building structure. To enhance system durability and performance, sway brace installation should show evidence of good craftsmanship in conformance to approved drawings, correctly assembled and mounted at proper angles on a plane that corresponds to the parallel and perpendicular axis of the system pipe.

The maximum allowable loads have been derived for the controlling condition (braces in compres­sion) using allowable stress design provisions of American Insti­tute of Steel Construction (AISC) 360, Specification for Structural Steel Buildings. In determining allowable horizontal loads in the tables, a modulus of elasticity (E) of 29,000 ksi, a yield stress (F. y) of 36 ksi, and an effective length factor (K) of 1.0 were assumed, since these are common. If these values are different in a specific situation, table values might need to be adjusted. Gross section properties are used for all shapes except for all-thread rods. For all-thread rods, area and radius of gyration are based on the minimum area of the threaded rod based on the radius at the root of the threads. � A. 18 .5.12 Concrete anchors can be cast-in-place [installed before the concrete is placed - see Figure A.18.5.12 (a) and Figure A.18.5. 12( b)] or post-installed [installed in hardened concrete - see Figure A.18.5.12(",

Examples of cast-in-place concrete anchors are embedded steel bolts or concrete inserts. There are several types of post-installed anchors, including expansion anchors, chemical or adhesive anchors, and under­cut anchors. The criteria in Table 18.5.12.2 (a) through Table 18.5.12.2(j) are based on the use of listed cast-in-place concrete inserts and listed post-installed wedge expansion anchors. The values for \"effective embedment\" for cast-in-place anchors and \"nominal embedment\" for post-installed anchors as shown in the tables represent the majority of commonly available anchors on the market at the time of publishing. Use of other anchors in concrete should be in accordance with the listing provisions of the anchor. Anchorage designs are usable under allowable stress design (ASD) methods.

This causes the wedge to be pulled onto a coned section of the anchor and presses the wedge against the wall of the hole. Undercut anchors might or might not be torque-controlled. Typically, the main hole is drilled, a special second drill bit is inserted into the hole, and flare is drilled at the base of the main hole. Some anchors are self-drilling and do not require a second drill bit.

A.18 .6.1 Wires used for piping restraints should be attached to the branch line with two tight turns around the pipe and fastened with four tight turns within 1 � in. (38 mm) and should be attached to the structure in accordance with the details shown in Figure A.18.6.1 (a) through Figure A.18.6 .1 (d) or other approved method. A.18.6. 1 (5) See Figure A.18.6.1 (5) (a) and Figure A.18.6.1 (5) (b) . When hangers are installed on both sides of the pipe, the l/ r is not restricted. A.18.6.4 Modern seismic codes require branch lines to be restrained, both to limit interaction of the pipe with other portions of the structure and to limit stresses in the pipes to permissible limits. The maximum spacing between restraints is dependent on the seismic coefficient, C\", as shown in Table 18.6.4(a) . Table 18.6.4 (a) has been limited to 2 in.

(65 mm) or larger are required to be seismically braced. It is not the intent of this section to require restraint of piping associated with valve trim, water motor gong piping, air or nitrogen supply piping, or other piping that is not essential to the operation of the sprinkler system. Essential piping such as fire pump sensing lines and diesel fuel lines are some exam­ples of small piping that should be restrained. A.18.6.6 Such restraint can be provided by using the restrain­ing wire discussed in 18.6. 1. For the purposes of determining the need for restraint, the length of the sprig is determined by measuring the length of the exposed pipe and does not include the fittings and sprinkler.

A.18 .8 When using a pipestand to support the gravity load of a water-based fire protection system in an earthquake area, care should be taken in planning the seismic protection. This includes close attention to the differential movement between the system and the building or other components. N A.19.1.1 More than one design approach can be selected for a single building or system. It is the designer's discretion as to which design approaches or methods to utilize; prior approval by the authority having jurisdiction is not required. A.19.1.2 The situation frequently arises where a small area of a higher hazard is surrounded by a lesser hazard. For example, consider a 600 ft2 (56 m2) area consisting of 10 ft (3 m) high on-floor storage of cartoned nonexpanded plastic commodities surrounded by a plastic extruding operation in a 15 ft ( 4.6 m) high building.

In accordance with Chapter 20, the density required for the plastic storage must meet the requirements for extra hazard (Group 1) occupancies. The plastic extruding operation should be considered an ordinary hazard (Group 2) occupancy. In accordance with Chapter 19, the corresponding discharge densities should be 0.3 gpm/ft2 (12.2 mm/min) over 2500 ft2 (230 m2) for the storage and 0.2 gpm/ft2 (8.1 mm/ min) over 1500 ft2 (140 m2) for the remainder of the area. (Also see Chapter 19 for the required minimum areas of operation.) If the storage area is not separated from the surrounding area by a wall or partition (see 19.1 .2), the size of the operating area is determined by the higher hazard storage. For example, the operating area is 2500 ft2 (230 m2). The system must be able to provide the 0.3 gpm/ft2 (12.2 mm/min) density over the storage area and 15 ft ( 4.6 m) beyond.

While the other codes and standards can factor in the presence of a sprin­kler system in the determination of the manual fire flow requirement, the sprinkler system water demand and manual fire flow demand are intended to be separate stand-alone calcu­lations.

  "ANNEX A A-19-L 6A For fully sprinklered buildings, if hose valves or stations are provided on a combination sprinkler riser and standpipe for fire department use in accordance with NFPA 14, the hydraulic calculation for the sprinkler system is not required to include the standpipe allowance. A-19-L7 A series of 10 full-scale fire tests and limited-scale test­ing were conducted to determine the impact ofHVLS fan oper­ation on the performance of sprinkler systems. The project, sponsored by the Property Insurance Research Group (PIRG) and other industry groups, was coordinated by the Fire Protec­tion Research Foundation (FPRF). The complete test report, High Volume/Low Speed Fan and Sprinkler Operation - Ph. 2 Final Report (2011), is available from the FPRF. Both control mode density area and early suppression fast response sprinklers were tested. Successful results were obtained when the HVLS fan was shut down upon the activation of the first sprinkler followed by a 90-second delay. Other methods of fan shutdown were also tested including shutdown by activation of air sampling-type detection and ionization-type smoke detectors.

Earlier fan shut­down resulted in less commodity damage. A-19-2- L1 This approach is based on a general occupancy classification applied to the building or a portion of the build­ing. A-19-2-2-5 The additional pressure that is needed at the level of the water supply to account for sprinkler elevation is 0.433 psi/ft (0.098 bar/m) of elevation above the water supply. A-19-2-3-L 4(1) The area of sprinkler operation typically encompasses enough of the floor area to make-up the mini­mum allowed size of the remote area up to the entire area of a single floor of the building. A.19.2.3 .L 5.1 This section is included to compensate for possible delay in operation of sprinklers from fires in combusti­ble concealed spaces found in wood frame, brick veneer, and ordinary construction. In order for the minimum 3000 ft2 (280 m2) requirement for the size of the remote area to not be extended to the adjacent area, the qualifYing concealed space must be separated by the entire fire-rated assembly. Such assemblies often have combus­tible structural members s",
  "he remote area to not be extended to the adjacent area, the qualifYing concealed space must be separated by the entire fire-rated assembly. Such assemblies often have combus­tible structural members separating the exterior membranes that can create a concealed combustible space that can qualify for omitting sprinkler protection. If the fire-rated assembly is the qualifYing concealed space, an interior fire would greatly reduce the assigned fire-rated duration. A.19.2.3.L5.2( 4) Composite wood joists are not considered solid wood joists for the purposes of this section. Their web members are too thin and easily penetrated to adequately compartment a fire in an unsprinklered space. Application of this item is not affected by the depth of the joist channel except in determining the volume. The concealed space above the insulation can be an attic, roof space, or floor space within a floor assembly. A.19.2. 3.L 5.2(10) The gypsum board (or equivalent material) used as the firestopping will compartment the concealed space and restrict the ability for fire to spread beyond 160 ft3 ( 4.5 m3) zones covering multiple joist channels.

A.19.2.3.2.5 Where extended coverage sprinklers are used and the design area (after appropriate increases) is satisfied by five sprinklers, no additional increase is required. With regard to preaction systems, the discharge criteria of Chapter 11 are writ- 13-495 ten based upon the assumption that the release system will acti­vate before the sprinkler system. It is generally accepted that smoke detectors and rate-of-rise detectors are more sensitive than sprinklers and that fixed-temperature release devices with RTis lower than sprinklers will react faster than sprinklers at similar spacings and locations. A.19.2.3.2.8 Example 1. A dry pipe sprinkler system (OH2) in a building with a ceiling slope exceeding 2 in 12 (16 .7 percent) . The initial area must be increased 30 percent for the dry pipe system and the resulting area an additional 30 percent for the roof slope. If the point 0.2 gpm/ft2 (8.2 mm/min) over 1500 ft2 (140 m2) is chosen from Figure 19.2. 3.1.1, the 1500 ft2 (140 m2) area is increased 450 ft2 (42 m2) to 1950 ft2 (180 m2), whic",
  "t for the roof slope. If the point 0.2 gpm/ft2 (8.2 mm/min) over 1500 ft2 (140 m2) is chosen from Figure 19.2. 3.1.1, the 1500 ft2 (140 m2) area is increased 450 ft2 (42 m2) to 1950 ft2 (180 m2), which is then further increased 585 ft2 (54 m2) . The final discharge criterion is then 0.2 gpm/ft2 (8.2 mm/min) over 2535 ft2 (235 m2) . Example 2. A wet pipe sprinkler system (light hazard) in a building with a 16 ft 8 in. (5.1 m) ceiling and a slope exceeding 2 in 12 (16 .7 percent) employs quick-response sprinklers quali­fYing for a 30 percent reduction as permitted by 19.2.3.2.3. The initial area must be increased 30 percent for the ceiling slope and the resulting area decreased 30 percent for quick-response sprinklers. It does not matter whether the reduction is applied first. If a discharge density of 0.1 gpm/ft2 (4.1 mm/min) over 1500 ft2 (140 m2) is chosen from Figure 19.2.3. 1.1, the 1500 ft2 (140 m2) is increased 450 ft2 (42 m2) , resulting in 1950 ft2 (18 0 m2), which is then decreased 585 ft2 (54 m2) . The final design is 0.1 gpm/ft2 (4.1 mm/min) over 1365 ft2 (12 5 m2). A. 19.2.3.3. 1 This subsection allows for calculation of the sprin­klers in the largest room, so long as th",

A. 19.2.3.3. 1 This subsection allows for calculation of the sprin­klers in the largest room, so long as the calculation produces the greatest hydraulic demand among selection of rooms and communicating spaces. For example, in a case where the larg­est room has four sprinklers and a smaller room has two sprin­klers but communicates through unprotected openings with three other rooms, each having two sprinklers, the smaller room and group of communicating spaces should also be calculated. Corridors are rooms and should be considered as such. Walls can terminate at a substantial suspended ceiling and need not be extended to a rated floor slab above for this section to be applied. A. 19.2.3A.2 This section is intended to apply to all types of systems including dry pipe and preaction systems. A. 19.3.

The protection area for residential sprinklers with extended coverage areas is defined in the listing of the sprinkler as a maximum square area for pendent sprinklers or a square or rectangular area. Listing information is presented in even 2 ft (600 mm) increments for residential sprinklers. When a sprin­kler is selected for an application, its area of coverage must be equal to or greater than both the length and width of the hazard area. For example, if the hazard to be protected is a room 14 ft 6 in. (4.4 m) wide and 20 ft 8 in. (6.3 m) long, a sprinkler that is listed to protect an area of 16 ft x 22 ft ( 4.9 m x 6.7 m) must be selected.

  "13-496 INSTALlATION OF SPRINKLER SYSTEMS When a single compartment has a branch line with four or more sprinklers, the calculation should include all four sprin­klers on the one branch line. When the remote area consists of eight sprinklers in compliance with 19.3.1.2.1, it is not neces­sary to include all eight sprinklers on the one branch line. One should include sprinklers that are adjacent when viewed as a group and not simply viewed as being next to one downstream sprinkler. A.19.3. 1.2 It should be noted that the provisions of Section 19.2 do not normally apply to the residential sprinkler design approach. The reference to 19.2.3. 1.5.2 is merely to provide a consistent approach between the occupancy hazard fire control approach and the residential sprinkler design approach with respect to unsprinklered combustible concealed spaces.

A.20.3.2 .2.2.1 For example, Class II will become Class IV, and Class III and Class IV will become a cartoned nonexpanded Group A plastic commodity. A.20.4 Specification of the type, amount, and arrangement of combustibles for any commodity classification is essentially an attempt to define the potential fire severity, based on its burn­ing characteristics, so the fire can be successfully controlled by the prescribed sprinkler protection for the commodity class. In actual storage situations, however, many storage arrays do not fit precisely into one of the fundamental classifications; there­fore, the user needs to make judgments after comparing each classification to the existing storage conditions.

  "er needs to make judgments after comparing each classification to the existing storage conditions. Storage arrays consist of thousands of products, which makes it impossible to specify all the acceptable variations for any class. As an alterna- tive, a variety of common products are classified in this annex based on judgment, loss experience, and fire test results. Table A.20.4(a) provides examples of commodities not addressed by the classifications in Section 20.4. The commodi­ties listed in Table A.20.4(a) are outside the scope of NFPA 13 protection.

Table A.20.4(b) is an alphabetized list of commodities with corresponding classifications. Table A.20.4.1, Table A.20.4.2, Table A.20.4.3, Table A.20.4.4, and Table A.20.4.5.1 provide examples of commodities within a specific class. A.20A. l See Table A.20.4. l. A.20A.2 See Table A.20.4.2.

  "Class IV commodity, see Table A.20.4.4. A.20A.5 The categories listed in 20.4.5.1, 20.4.6, and 20.4.7 are based on unmodified plastic materials. The use of fire- or flame-retarding modifiers or the physical form of the material could change the classification. 13-499 The addition of fire retardants to plastic should not be relied upon as the sole basis for a reduction in classification given the unknown performance of the fire retardant under a storage scenario. It is expected that full-scale or commodity classifica­tion type testing would be necessary to justifY any such reduc­tion in classification. No reduction in classification should be given for plastics simply because they contain a fire retardant. Plastic materials not specifically classified in 20.4.5 should be protected as Group A plastics unless full-scale or commodity classification type testing demonstrates otherwise. It is not possible to classifY full-scale fire performance of plastics by looking solely at heat of combustion. Plastic materials should not be categorized into a Group (A, B, or C) based upon comparing heat of combustion with values for plastics already classified in NFPA 13. A.20.4.5.1 See Table A.20.4",
  "stion. Plastic materials should not be categorized into a Group (A, B, or C) based upon comparing heat of combustion with values for plastics already classified in NFPA 13. A.20.4.5.1 See Table A.20.4. 5.l. A.20A.5.2 Generally, expanded plastics are low-density materi­als and commonly referred to as \"foam plastics.\" A.20.4.8 All arrangements of exposed plastics cannot be protected with all types of sprinklers. Only certain combina­tions of ceiling sprinklers and in-rack sprinklers have been found to provide acceptable protection. No full-scale fire test­ing has been performed that has determined acceptable crite­ria for exposed expanded plastics. Factory Mutual has published criteria in its data sheets to protect exposed expan­ded plastics based on a risk analysis and small/intermediate­scale test data. Some authorities having jurisdiction accept that criteria as an alternative to the intent of NFPA 13.

These classifications were derived from a series of large-scale and laboratory-type small­scale fire tests. It is recognized that not all paper in a class burns with exactly the same characteristics. Paper can be soft or hard, thick or thin, or heavy or light and can also be coated with various materials. The broad range of papers can be classified according to various properties. One important property is basis weight, which is defined as the weight of a sheet of paper of a specified area. Two broad cate­gories are recognized by industry - paper and paperboard. Paperboard normally has a basis weight of 20 lb (100 g/m2) or greater measured on a 1000 ft2 (93 m2) sheet. Stock with a basis weight less than 20 lb/1000 ft2 (100 g",

Stock with a basis weight less than 20 lb/1000 ft2 (100 g/m2) is normally catego­rized as paper. The basis weight of paper is usually measured on a 3000 ft2 (280 m2) sheet. The basis weight of paper can also be measured on the total area of a ream of paper, which is normally the case for the following types of printing and writ­ing papers: (1) Bond paper - 500 sheets, 17 in. x 22 in. (425 mm x 550 mm) = 1300 ft2 (12 0 m2) per ream (2) Book paper - 500 sheets, 25 in. x 38 in. (625 mm x 950 mm) = 3300 ft2 (305 m2) per ream (3) Index paper- 500 sheets, 25\\12 in. x 30\\12 in. (640 mm x 765 mm) = 2700 ft2 (250 m2) per ream (4) Bristol paper- 500 sheets, 22\\12 in. x 35 in. (565 mm x 890 mm) = 2734 ft2 (255 m2) per ream (5) Tag paper - 500 sheets, 24 in. x 36 in. (600 mm x 900 mm) = 3000 ft2 (280 m2) per ream For the purposes of this standard, all basis weights are expressed in lb/1000 ft2 (kg/93 m2) of paper. To determine the basis weight per 1000 ft2 (93 m2) for papers measured on a sheet of different area, the following formula should be applied:",
  "weights are expressed in lb/1000 ft2 (kg/93 m2) of paper.

Heavyweight paper burns more slowly than lightweight paper. Full-scale roll paper fire tests were conducted with the following types of paper: (1) Linerboard - 42 lb/1 000 ft2 (0.2 kg/m2) nominal basis weight (2) Newsprint - 10 lb/1000 ft2 (50 g/m2) nominal basis weight (3) Tissue- 5 lb/1000 ft2 (20 g/m2) nominal basis weight The rate of firespread over the surface of the tissue rolls was extremely rapid in the full-scale fire tests.

Based on the overall results of these full-scale tests, along with additional data from small-scale testing of various paper grades, the broad range of papers has been classified into three major categories as follows: (1) Heavyweight - Basis weight of 20 lb/1 000 ft2 (100 g/m2) or greater (2) Mediumweight - Basis weight of 10 lb to 20 lb/1000 ft2 (100 g/m2) (3) Lightweight - Basis weight of less than 10 lb/1000 ft2 (50 g/m2) and tissues regardless of basis weight The following SI units were used for conversion of U.S. customary units: li b= 0.45 kg 1 in. = 25 mm 1ft= 0.3 m 1 ft2 = 0.09 m2 The various types of papers normally found in each of the four major categories are provided in Table A.20.4. 10.

Paragraphs 20.5.3.1 through 20.5.3.4 identify the general terms of rack storage that identify which type of rack and shelving criteria is to be used in Chapters 21 through 25. A.20. 5.3.2 Slatting of decks or walkways or the use of open grating as a substitute for automatic sprinkler thereunder is not acceptable. In addition, where shelving of any type is employed, it is for the basic purpose of providing an intermediate support between the structural members of the rack. As a result, it becomes almost impossible to define and maintain transverse flue spaces across the rack as required.

A.20.8 A series of 10 full-scale fire tests and limited-scale test­ing were conducted to determine the impact of HVLS fan oper­ation on the performance of sprinkler systems. The project, sponsored by the Property Insurance Research Group (PIRG) and other industry groups, was coordinated by the Fire Protec­tion Research Foundation (FPRF). The complete test report, High Volume/Low Speed Fan and Sprinkler Operation - Ph. 2 Final Report (2011) , is available from the FPRF. Both control mode density area and early suppression fast response sprinklers were tested. Successful results were obtained when the HVLS fan was shut down upon the activation of the first sprinkler followed by a 90-second delay.

Other methods of fan shutdown were also tested including shutdown by activation of air sampling-type detection and ionization-type smoke detectors. Earlier fan shut­down resulted in less commodity damage. A.20.9.2 The fire protection system design should consider the maximum storage height. For new sprinkler installations, maximum storage height is the usable height at which commodities can be stored above the floor while the minimum required unobstructed space below sprinklers is maintained. Where evaluating existing situations, maximum storage height is the maximum existing storage height if space between the sprinklers and storage is equal to or greater than that required. Building heights where baled cotton is stored should allow for proper clearance between the pile height and sprinkler deflectors. Fire tests of high-piled storage have shown that sprinklers are generally more effective if located 1 \\'2 ft to 4\\'2 ft (450 mm to 1.4 m) above the storage height.

  "1.4 m) above the storage height. A.20.9.2.5 In the example shown in Figure A.20.9.2.5, the maximum ceiling height shown is 30 ft (9.1 m). Sprinkler protection under the highest part of the ceiling must be designed for that height to a point at least 15 ft ( 4.6 m) beyond where the ceiling height drops to 25 ft (7.6 m). Sprinkler protection beyond that point can be designed for a 25 ft (7.6 m) ceiling. A.20.9.4. 1 Batt insulation creates an effective thermal barrier and can be considered the ceiling/roof deck when determin- ing the clearance to ceiling. The insulation needs to be instal­led in each pocket (not just above the sprinkler) and attached to the ceiling/roof in such a manner that it will not fall out during a fire prior to sprinkler activation. A.20.9.5.1 Sprinkler protection criteria are based on the assumption that roof vents and draft curtains are not being used. (See Section C.6.) A.20.9.5.3 Draft curtains have been shown to have a negative effect on sprinkler effectiveness. If they are mandated, extreme care needs to be taken to minimize any potential impacts.

A.20.10.1 In order for the minimum 3000 ft2 (280 m2) requirement for the size of the remote area to not be extended to the adjacent area, the qualifying concealed space must be separated by the entire fire-rated assembly. Such assemblies often have combustible structural members separating the exterior membranes that can create a concealed combustible space that can qualify for omitting sprinkler protection. If the fire-rated assembly is the qualifying concealed space, an inte­rior fire would greatly reduce the assigned fire-rated duration. A.20.11.1 This subsection allows for calculation of the sprin­klers in the largest room, so long as the calculation produces the greatest hydraulic demand among selection of rooms and communicating spaces. For example, in a case where the larg­est room has four sprinklers and a smaller room has two sprin­klers but communicates through unprotected openings with three other rooms, each having two sprinklers, the smaller room and group of communicating spaces should also be calculated.

  "ANNEX A tion of the system should have an approved standby power source. Where high-expansion foam is contemplated as the protec­tion media, consideration should be given to possible damage to the commodity from soaking and corrosion. Consideration also should be given to the problems associated with the removal of the foam after discharge. A.20.13 The situation frequently arises where a small area of a higher hazard is surrounded by a lesser hazard. For example, consider a 600 ft2 (56 m2) area consisting of 10 ft (3 m) high on-floor storage of cartoned nonexpanded plastic commodities surrounded by a plastic extruding operation in a 15 ft ( 4.6 m) high building. In accordance with Chapter 12, the density required for the plastic storage must meet the requirements for extra hazard (Group 1) occupancies. The plastic extruding operation should be considered an ordinary hazard (Group 2) occupancy. In accordance with Chapter 11, the corresponding discharge densities should be 0.3 gpm/ft2 (12.2 mm/min) over 2500 ft2 (230 m2) for the storage and 0.2 gpm/ft2 (8.1 mm/ min) over 1500 ft2 (140 m2) for the remainder of the area.

  "2.2 mm/min) over 2500 ft2 (230 m2) for the storage and 0.2 gpm/ft2 (8.1 mm/ min) over 1500 ft2 (140 m2) for the remainder of the area. (Also see Chapter 11 for the required minimum areas of operation.) If the storage area is not separated from the surrounding area by a wall or partition (see 19.1 .2), the size of the operating area is determined by the higher hazard storage. For example, the operating area is 2500 ft2 (230 m2). The system must be able to provide the 0.3 gpm/ft2 (12.2 mm/min) density over the storage area and 15 ft ( 4.6 m) beyond. If part of the remote area is outside the 600 ft2 (56 m2) plus the 15 ft (4.6 m) overlap, only 0.2 gpm/ft2 (8.1 mm/min) is needed for that portion. If the storage is separated from the surrounding area by a floor-to-ceiling/roof partition that is capable of delaying heat from a fire on one side from fusing sprinklers on the other side, the size of the operating area is determined by the occu­pancy of the surrounding area. In this example, the design area is 1500 ft2 (140 m2) . A 0.3 gpm/ft2 (12.2 mm/min) density is needed within the separated area with 0.2 gpm/ft2 (8.1 mm/ min) in the remainder of the remote area.

Where high temperature-rated sprinklers are installed at the ceiling, high temperature-rated sprinklers also should extend beyond storage in accordance with Table A.20. 13. When the small higher hazard area is larger than the required minimum area dictated by the surrounding occu­pancy, even when separated by draft curtains, barriers, or parti­tions capable of delaying heat, the size of the operating area is determined by the higher hazard storage. A.20.14 Authorities having jurisdiction have varying require­ments for plant first-aid and fire-fighting operations. Examples include no hose stations, hose stations with hose line and nozzles, and hose stations with no hose line or nozzles. A.20. 15.2.1 Where tanks serve sprinklers only, they can be sized to provide the duration required for the sprinkler system, ignoring any hose stream demands.

Where tanks serve some combination of sprinklers, inside hose stations, outside hose stations, or domestic/process use, the tank needs to be capable of providing the duration for the equipment that is fed from the tank, but the demands of equipment not connected to the tank can be ignored. Where a tank is used for both domestic/ process water and fire protection, the entire duration demand 13-513 of the domestic/process water does not need to be included in the tank if provisions are made to segregate the tank so that adequate fire protection water is always present or if provisions are made to automatically cut off the simultaneous use in the event of fire.

Preaction systems should be considered for rack storage occupancies that are unheated, particularly where in-rack sprinklers are installed or for those occupancies that are highly susceptible to water damage. A.20.17 Idle pallet storage introduces a severe fire condition. Stacking idle pallets in piles is the best arrangement of combus­tibles to promote rapid spread of fire, heat release, and complete combustion. Mter pallets are used for a short time in warehouses, they dry out and edges become frayed and splin­tered. In this condition, they are subject to easy ignition from a small ignition source. Again, high piling increases considerably both the challenge to sprinklers and the probability of involv­ing a large number of pallets when fire occurs. Therefore, it is preferable to",
  "ignition source. Again, high piling increases considerably both the challenge to sprinklers and the probability of involv­ing a large number of pallets when fire occurs. Therefore, it is preferable to store pallets outdoors where possible. A fire in stacks of idle plastic or wood pallets is one of the greatest challenges to sprinklers. The undersides of the pallets create a shadow area on which a fire can grow and expand to other dry or partially wet areas. This process of jumping to other dry, closely located, parallel, combustible surfaces contin­ues until the fire bursts through the top of the stack. Once this happens, very little water is able to reach the base of the fire. The only practical method of stopping a fire in a large concen­tration of pallets with ceiling sprinklers is by means of prewet­ting. In high stacks, this cannot be done without abnormally high water supplies. The storage of empty wood pallets should not be permitted in an unsprinklered warehouse containing other storage.

  "13-514 INSTALlATION OF SPRINKLER SYSTEMS A series of seven large-scale fire tests involving idle wood pallets stored on the floor was conducted at Underwriters Laboratories in 2009 and 2010. This testing was conducted to investigate the performance of an upright sprinkler having a nominal K-factor of 11. 2 (160) when installed to protect a 8ft (2.4 m) high array of new 4-way entry, softwood pallets under a 30 ft (9.1 m) ceiling. The pallets used for this test series were supplied by CHEP USA. The impact of the sprinkler tempera­ture rating on fire control performance was the key variable investigated during this test series. Except for the temperature rating of the sprinkler's heat responsive element, the same sprinkler design was used for all seven tests. Three tests were conducted using 286°F (14 1 oq temperature-rated sprinklers, two tests were conducted using 200°F (93°C) temperature­rated sprinklers, and two tests conducted using 155°F (68°C) temperature-rated sprinklers. The ignition location for all tests was centered between four sprinklers.

  "tion location for all tests was centered between four sprinklers. To enhance test repeata­bility, the four sprinklers nearest the ignition location were arranged to discharge water when the first sprinkler operated. The results of this test series are summarized in Table A.20. 17. The results of this large-scale fire test series indicated that sprinklers in the 155°F (68°C) and 200°F (93°C) temperature ratings performed significantly better than the 286oF (141 oq temperature-rated sprinklers as evidenced by a reduced number of operated sprinklers and lower steel temperatures.

A.21.1.2 The reasons for using larger orifice sprinklers in stor­age situations are based on a number of fire tests in recent years that continue to show an advantage of the larger orifice [K-11.2 (K-160) and K-16.8 (K-240)] sprinklers over the K-5.6 (K-80) and even the K-8.0 (K-115) orifice sprinklers.

  "comparisons show the advantage of the larger orifices. A possibly even bigger advant­age can be seen when investigating the performance of larger orifice sprinklers in the real world condition of high initial operating pressures. The volume of water discharged through the larger K-factor for the initial sprinklers has three significant effects: (1) First, the increase in sheer volume flowing through the larger orifice enhances performance. For example, a 165 psi (11 bar) initial operating pressure would provide 102.8 gpm (390 L/min) from a K-8.0 (K-115) , while the K-16.8 (K-240) will discharge 215.8 gpm (815 L/min) . (2) Second, fire testing at high pressures [100+ psi (6.9 bar)] with K-5.6 (K-80) and K-8.0(K-115) (when high fire updrafts occur) has shown less water penetration and more sprinkler skipping. When fire testing the K-11.2 (K-160) and K-16.8 (K-240) sprinklers at 100+ psi (6.9 bar), more water penetration is evident and little or no sprinkler skipping has occurred. (3) Third, with such high initial discharge rates among K-16.8 (K-240) sprinklers, the friction loss in the supply pipes would be greater. This would result in lower initial pres­sures than a K-8.0 (K-115)",
  "ird, with such high initial discharge rates among K-16.8 (K-240) sprinklers, the friction loss in the supply pipes would be greater. This would result in lower initial pres­sures than a K-8.0 (K-115) as well as being farther down the water supply curve with greater flows resulting in lower initial operating pressures. Figure A.21.1. 2 highlights the differences between the K-8.0(K-115) and K-16.8 (K-240) initial operating pressures. The higher flow rate of the K-16.8 (K-240) sprinkler results in greater friction losses in the initial operating heads as compared to the K-8.0 (K-115) sprinkler. Combined with the lower pressure available on the water supply curve, the end result is a self-regulating K-factor allowing greater initial pres­sures without a negative impact. Table A.21.1 .2(c) summarizes the paper product testing. The results. The tests indicated that even at a high tempera­ture of 286°F (14PC) , the K-8.0 (K-115) sprinklers operating at higher pressures were not effective in controlling the fire. Conversely, the K-16.8 (K-240) sprinkler was able to control the fire at the lower temperature [155°F (68oC) ], by operating sooner, and at lower, self-regulating flowing pressur",
  "controlling the fire. Conversely, the K-16.8 (K-240) sprinkler was able to control the fire at the lower temperature [155°F (68oC) ], by operating sooner, and at lower, self-regulating flowing pressures. Conclusions. The larger K-factor of the K-16.8 (K-240) sprin­kler is not affected by high initial operating pressures. In fact, the protection is enhanced, providing better fire protection. The ability to use lower-rated temperatures, such as 155°F (68°C) in lieu of286°F (14PC) , shows that the performance of the initial operating sprinklers is effective in controlling the fire. Therefore, using high-temperature sprinklers to reduce the number of surrounding rings of sprinklers to open is not necessary when using the K-16.8 (K-240) technology. In short, the K-16.8 (K-240) sprinkler proved highly effective when subjected to high initial operating pressures.

  "13-518 INSTALlATION OF SPRINKLER SYSTEMS The minimum design density for a dry sprinkler system is 0.15 gpm/ft2 over 2600 ft2 (6.1 mm/min over 240 m2) for Class III. The corresponding minimum density at 3000 ft2 (280 m2) is 0.17 gpm/ft2 (7 mm/min) (satisfied); 1.3 x 3000 ft2 (280 m2) = 3900 ft2 (363 m2), 0.17 gpm/ft2 over 3900 ft2 (7 mm/min over 360 m2). The design density and area of application equals 0.26 gpm/ft2 over 3900 ft2 (10.6 mm/min over 360 m2). A.21.2.1 (3) Full-scale tests show no appreciable difference in the number of sprinklers that open for either nonencapsulated or encapsulated products up to 15 ft ( 4.6 m) high. Test data are not available for encapsulated products stored higher than 15 ft ( 4.6 m). However, in rack storage tests involving encapsu­lated storage 20 ft (6.1 m) high, increased protection was needed over that for nonencapsulated storage. The protection specified contemplates a maximum of 10 ft (3.0 m) clearances from top of storage to sprinkler deflectors for storage heights of 15 ft ( 4.6 m) and higher.

A.21. 3.2 There are few storage facilities in which the commod­ity mix or storage arrangement remains constant, and a designer should be aware that the introduction of different materials can change protection requirements considerably. Design should be based on higher densities and areas of appli­cation, and the various reductions allowed should be applied cautiously. For evaluation of existing situations, however, the allowances can be quite helpful. A.21.3.3 Test data are not available for all combinations of commodities, storage heights, and clearances to ceiling. Some of the protection criteria in this standard are based on extrapo­lations of test data for other commodities and storage configu­rations, as well as available loss data. For example, there are very limited test data for storage of expanded plastics higher than 20 ft (6.1 m). The protection criteria in this standard for expanded plastics higher than 20 ft (6.1 m) are extrapolated from test data for expanded plastics storage 20 ft (6.1 m) and less in height and test data for nonex­panded plastics above 20 ft (6.1 m) . Further examples can be found in the protection",
  "xtrapolated from test data for expanded plastics storage 20 ft (6.1 m) and less in height and test data for nonex­panded plastics above 20 ft (6.1 m) . Further examples can be found in the protection criteria for clearance to ceiling up to 15 ft ( 4.6 m). Test data are limited for clearance to ceiling greater than 10 ft (3.0 m). It should be assumed that, if protection is adequate for a given storage height in a building of a given height, the same protection will protect storage of any lesser height in the same building. For example, protection adequate for 20 ft (6.1 m) storage in a 30 ft (9.1 m) building [10 ft (3.0 m) clearance to ceiling] would also protect 15 ft (4.6 m) storage in a 30 ft (9.1 m) build­ing [15 ft ( 4.6 m) clearance to ceiling]. Therefore, the protec­tion criteria in Table 21.3.3 (a) for 15 ft (4.6 m) clearance to ceiling are based on the protection criteria for storage 5 ft (1. 5 m) higher than the indicated height with 10 ft (3.0 m) clearance to ceiling.

A.21 .3.3.1 Two direct comparisons between ordinary tempera­ture- and high temperature-rated sprinklers are possible, as follows: (1) With nonexpanded polyethylene 1 gal (3.8 L) bottles in corrugated cartons, a 3ft (0.9 m) clearance, and the same density, approximately the same number of sprinklers operated (nine at high temperature versus seven at ordi­nary temperature) (2) With exposed, expanded polystyrene meat trays, a 9.5 ft (1.9 m) clearance, and the same density, three times as many ordinary temperature-rated sprinklers operated as did high temperature-rated sprinklers (11 at high temperature versus 33 at ordinary temperature) A.21.3 .3.2 The \"up to\" in Table 21.3.3 (a) and Table 21.3.3( b) is intended to aid in the interpolation of densities between stor­age heights.

  "• ANNEX A A-2L7 The protection criteria in Table 21.7.1 (a) and Table 21.7.1 (b) have been developed from fire test data. Protection requirements for other storage methods are beyond the scope of this standard at the present time. From fire testing with densities of 0.45 gpm/ft2 (18.3 mm/min) and higher, there have been indications that large orifice sprinklers at greater than 50 ft2 ( 4.6 m2) spacing produce better results than the \\12 in. (15 mm) orifice sprinklers at 50 ft2 ( 4.6 m2) spacing. Table 21.7.1 (a) is based on operation of standard sprinklers. Use of quick-response or other special sprinklers should be based on appropriate tests as approved by the authority having jurisdiction. The current changes to Table 21.7.1 (a) and Table 21.7.1 (b) represent test results from rubber tire fire tests performed at the Factory Mutual Research Center. Storage heights and configurations, or both [e.g., automated material-handling systems above 30 ft (9.1 m)], beyond those indicated in the table have not had sufficient test data devel­oped to establish recommended criteria.

Detailed engineering reviews of the protection should be conducted and approved by the authority having jurisdiction. A-2LSA Generally, more sprinklers open in fires involving roll paper storage protected by sprinklers rated below the high­temperature range. An increase of 67 percent in the design area should be considered. A.22.L5.4 An evaluation for each field situation should be made to determine the worst applicable height-clearance to ceiling relationship that can be expected to appear in a particu­lar case. Fire tests have shown that considerably greater demands occur where the clearance to ceiling is 10 ft (3.0 m) as compared to 3 ft (900 mm) and where a pile is stable as compared to an unstable pile. Since a system is designed for a particular clearance to ceiling, the system could be inadequate when significant areas do not have piling to the design height and larger clearances to ceiling. This can also be true where the packaging or arrangement is changed so that stable piling is created where unstable piling existed.

  "his can also be true where the packaging or arrangement is changed so that stable piling is created where unstable piling existed. Recognition of these conditions is essential to avoid installation of protection that is inadequate or becomes inadequate because of changes. No tests were conducted simulating a peaked roof configura­tion. However, it is expected that the principles of Chapter 20 still apply. The worst applicable height-clearance to ceiling relationship that can be expected to occur should be found, and protection should be designed for it. If storage is all at the same height, the worst height-clearance to ceiling relationship creating the greatest water demand would occur under the peak. If commodities are stored higher under the peak, the various height-clearance to ceiling relationships should be tried and the one creating the greatest water demand used for designing protection.

The tests used K-25.2 intermediate-temperature ESFR sprinklers with vertical barriers attached to the rack uprights at nominal 16 ft ( 4.9 m) apart. Vertical barriers of sheet metal and o/s in. plywood were both investigated. In Tests 1 through 6, transverse flue spaces between commodities were blocked. Comparing the results of Test 6, with blocked transverse flue spaces, and Test 7, with no blocking of transverse flue spaces, revealed the number of operated sprinklers decreased from 11 to 7 and improved suppression of the fire.

The area limitation between the vertical barriers and aisles indicated in 23.4. 7.2 will limit the depth of a multiple-row rack arrangement. The hose stream allowance and water supply duration requirements considered the burning characteristics of the exposed expanded plastic commodity, which generates a high rate of heat release very quickly. However, the commodity involved in the combustion process is quickly consumed after fire suppression or control is achieved.

A.26.7.1 NFPA 13 contains protection criteria for limited configurations of compact mobile storage units and materials stored. Storage arrangements not specifically addressed in NFPA 13 are outside the scope of the standard (i.e., protection • 13-533 for commodities other than paper files, magazines, or books in compact mobile storage units does not simply follow high-piled storage protection criteria for shelves or racks).

  "e protection criteria for shelves or racks). Where compact mobile storage configurations outside the scope of NFPA 13 are to be utilized, they must be addressed on a case­by-case basis with consideration given to the fact that no known sprinkler protection criteria is currently available. Additional protection features, such as rated construction, barriers within the storage, consideration for safe locating away from vulnera­ble areas, and methods for control or exhausting of the smoke, should be considered.

However, the fact that NFPA 13 does not provide a specific limit should not be taken as an endorsement that the formula can be used for any velocity of water flow. The formula was empirically determined using \"normal\" conditions. When the velocity in the pipe exceeds that which was used to determine the formula, the formula might no longer be valid. There has been some research performed (Huggins 1996) in which results using the Hazen-Williams formula and the Darcy­Weisbach formula were compared, and the conclusion was that XYZ AUTOMATIC SPRINKLER CO.

However, this procedure introduces difficulties when restoring a system to service after operation since it is not always clear which sprinklers go where. A.28.2A. 10 Where the normal pressure (P,) is used to calcu­late the flow from an orifice, the following assumptions should be used: (1) At any flowing outlet along a pipe, except the end outlet, only the normal pressure (P,) can act on the outlet. At the end outlet, the total pressure (P,) can act. The following should be considered end outlets: (a) The last flowing sprinkler on a dead-end branch line (b) The last flowing branch line on a dead-end cross main (c) Any sprinkler where a flow split occurs on a gridded branch line (d) Any branch line where a flow split occurs on a looped system (2) At any flowing outlet along a pipe, except the end outlet, the pressure acting to cause flow from the outlet is equal to the total pressure (P,) mi",
  "ine where a flow split occurs on a looped system (2) At any flowing outlet along a pipe, except the end outlet, the pressure acting to cause flow from the outlet is equal to the total pressure (P,) minus the velocity pressure (PvJ on the upstream (supply) side. (3) To find the normal pressure (P,) at any flowing outlet, except the end outlet, assume a flow from the outlet in question and determine the velocity pressure (PvJ for the total flow on the upstream side. Because normal pressure (P,) equals total pressure (P,) minus velocity pressure (P\"), the value of the normal pressure (P,) so found should result in an outlet flow approximately equal to the assumed flow; if not, a new value should be assumed, and the calculations should be repeated.

The addition of nitrogen will not remediate the corro­sion damage already incurred to the sprinkler system piping. It is recommended to assess existing piping to determine where replacement is necessary and where acceptable for continued use. The addition of nitrogen will remove the oxygen from the corrosion process, which will minimize continued corrosion but will not remove any previous damage. The use of compressed air is not always damaging to dry pipe or preaction sprinkler system piping. It has been used as a supervisory gas for nearly a century without catastrophic effects.

A-3 LL 4 Experience has shown that structures that are parti­ally sprinklered can be overrun by well-developed fires originat­ing in unsprinklered areas. Therefore, the entire vessel should be sprinklered whenever sprinkler systems are considered. A.3 L2.1 Sprinklers with a nominal K-factor of 2.8 ( 40) or less coupled with a system strainer minimize the potential for clog­ging. A.3L2.2 Where a marine thermal barrier is penetrated, limit­ing the opening around the sprinkler pipe to Y;6 in. (1 mm) is considered as meeting this requirement. A-3L2.4-1 When nonferrous materials are used, consideration should be given to protecting against galvanic corrosion where the nonferrous materials connect to steel pipe. Consideration 13-547 should also be given to protection against galvanic corrosion from pipe hangers in areas of high humidity.

  "igh humidity. The piping between the sea chest and the sprinkler zone valves are likely to see the frequent flow of saltwater when test­ing. Sprinkler zone piping will rarely, if ever, be exposed to salt­water. In such an event, NFPA 25 requires flushing of the piping. Even if the piping is not flushed, the saltwater will not be replenished and will lose oxygen content in fairly short order. Even if galvanized, the failure from corrosion from the inte­rior of the pipe is likely to be at all threaded connections, welded assembly connections, and where brass sprinklers thread into ferrous pipe. Only hot dipped galvanized after fabrication of assembly (as opposed to simply hot dipped galvanized pipe and fittings) will protect against some of those failures. Hot dipped galvanized after fabrication of assembly is practical from the sea chest to the sprinkler manifold where spaces are open and pipe is relatively large and uses flanged takedown joints instead of threaded unions. Hot dipped galvanized after fabrication of assembly is not practical in the sprinkler zone pipe where it is mainly field fit.

  "lvanized after fabrication of assembly is not practical in the sprinkler zone pipe where it is mainly field fit. A-3L2-5-1 When designing supports, the selection and spac­ing of pipe supports should take into account the pipe dimen­sions, mechanical and physical properties of piping materials and supports, operating temperature, thermal expansion effects, external loads, thrust forces, vibration, maximum accel­erations, differential motions to which the system might be subjected, and the type of support. The route of the vessel is intended to be descriptive of its usual operating area. For example, expected motion of the system on an ocean vessel is expected to be considerably greater than the motion of a vessel that operates on a river. A vessel that operates within the confines of any of the Great Lakes is expected to subject the system pipe to greater motion than would a vessel that operates on a lake such as Lake Tahoe. It is recommended that the designer review the require­ments for automatic sprinkler systems that are subject to earth­quakes.

  "or automatic sprinkler systems that are subject to earth­quakes. While it is obvious that shipboard motions and accelerations differ from those that occur during an earth­quake, the general principle of protecting the piping system against damage applies. Individual hanger design, however, will be very similar. Earthquake protection does not apply to ships; however, motions are similar to those that a ship will experience in a seaway. The design principles discussed in this section should be used as a guide for shipboard system design. A-3L2-5-3 Use of heat-sensitive materials for pipe hangers and supports might be desirable in some cases. Where heat-sensitive materials are used, the hangers and supports should be adequately protected by either the direct application of insula­tion or installation behind a marine thermal barrier.

Locking valves in the open position is not an acceptable substitute for the requirement of 31.2 .6.1 but can be done in addition to the supervision require­ment. A.31.2. 7. 1 International Shore Connections are portable universal couplings that permit connections of shipboard sprin­kler or firemain systems between one ship and another or between a shore facility and a ship. Both the ship and the shore facility are expected to have an international shore connection fitting such that in an emergency they can be attached to their respective fire hoses and bolted together to permit charging the ship's system. It must be portable to accommodate hose-to­hose connection and allow assistance from any position.

  "n of an additional fire boat connection might be required on-board vessels whose route is such that regular access to fire boats is possible. An additional fire boat connec­tion might not be necessary where fire boats are equipped to connect to the regular fire department connection. (See A.31.2 . 7. 7.) A.31.2. 7.7 Selection of the pipe thread for the fire depart­ment connection should be done very carefully. It is recom­mended that a 2� in. (63 mm) siamese connection with National Standard Hose Thread be used since a majority of fire department hose lines will be compatible with this thread. However, it must be noted that some fire jurisdictions might not be compatible with a connection of this type. Serious consideration should be given to the vessel's typical operating 700 800 1400 16 00 2800 3200 2650 3000 5300 6050 10 600 1210 0 area.

The international shore connection is required to ensure that all vessels fitted with sprinkler systems have at least one type of common connection. A.3 1.3.1 Special consideration should be given to the installa­tion of relief valves in all wet pipe systems. Ambient ship temperatures can vary greatly depending on operating environ­ment, duration of voyage, and failure of climate control systems. A.3 1. 4.2 Areas fitted primarily with multiple staterooms and corridors should be considered sleeping accommodation areas. A.3 1. 4.4 If combustibles are present such that they constitute a threat, the space should be sprinklered. One example would be the presence of large bundles of unsheathed computer or electrical cable. Typical amounts of lighting or control cabling should not be considered to constitute a fire threat.

  "alarms. A.31.5.2 For example, a design area of 1500 ft2 (140 m2) is used to design a sprinkler system for an unobstructed light hazard occupancy. In this case, the system must supply at least seven sprinklers that are installed within that area. If eight sprinklers are installed to protect windows within this design area, the water demand of these sprinklers is added to the total water demand. Thus, 15 sprinklers must be supplied by this system. A.3 1. 5.3 Hose stream flow need not be added to the water demand. The water supply for fire streams is supplied by sepa­rate fire pump(s) that supply the vessel's fire main. A.31.6.4 In vessels, the elevation of sprinklers with respect to the water supply varies as the vessel heels to either side or trims by the bow or stern. The water demand requirements can be increased or decreased under these conditions. This require­ment aligns the operational parameters of this safety system with that required for other machinery vital to the safety of the vessel.

B. l Figure B.l shows acceptable methods for interconnection of the fire protection and domestic water supply. B.2 Sprinkler System Performance Criteria. B.2.1 Sprinkler system performance criteria have been based on test data. The factors of safety are generally small, are not definitive, and can depend on expected (but not guaranteed) inherent characteristics of the sprinkler systems involved. These inherent factors of safety consist of the following: (l) The flow-declining pressure characteristic of sprinkler systems whereby the initial operating sprinklers discharge at a higher flow than with all sprinklers operating within the designated area. (2) The flow-declining pressure characteristic of water supplies, which is particularly steep where fire pumps are the water source. This characteristic similarly produces higher than design discharge at the initially operating sprinklers. The user of these standards can elect an additional factor of safety if the inherent factors are not considered adequate. B.2. 1.1 Performance-specifi",

B.2. 1.1 Performance-specified sprinkler systems, as opposed to scheduled systems, can be designed to take advantage of multiple loops or gridded configurations. Such configurations result in minimum line losses at expanded sprinkler spacing, in contrast to the older tree-type configurations, where advantage cannot be taken of multiple path flows. Where the water supply characteristics are relatively flat with pressures being only slightly above the required sprinkler pres­sure at the spacing selected, gridded systems with piping designed for minimal economic line losses can all but elimi­nate the inherent flow-declining pressure characteristic gener­ally assumed to exist in sprinkler systems. In contrast, the economic design of a tree-type system would likely favor a system design with closer sprinkler spacing and greater line To building Fire Fire protection connection Domestic conne ction� protection connection Domestic connection Conne ction within building Water supply main -------- r- --- --- FIGURE B. l Pe",

Elements that enter into the design of sprinkler systems include the following: (l) Selection of density and area of application (2) Geometry of the area of application (remote area) (3) Permitted pressure range at sprinklers ( 4) Determination of the water supply available (5) Ability to predict expected performance from calculated performance (6) Future upgrading of system performance (7) Size of sprinkler systems In developing sprinkler specifications, each of these elements needs to be considered individually. The most conser­vative design should be based on the application of the most stringent conditions for each of the elements. B.2.1.2 Selection of Density and Area of Application.

  "tions for each of the elements. B.2.1.2 Selection of Density and Area of Application. Specifi­cations for density and area of application are developed from NFPA standards and other standards. It is desirable to specify densities rounded upward to the nearest 0.005 gpm/ft2 (0.2 mm/min). Prudent design should consider reasonable-to-expect varia­tions in occupancy. This design would include not only varia­tions in type of occupancy but also, in the case of warehousing, the anticipated future range of materials to be stored, clear­ance to ceiling, types of arrays, packaging, pile height, and pile stability, as well as other factors. Design should also consider some degree of adversity at the time of a fire. To take this into account, the density and/or area of application can be increased. Another way is to use a dual-performance specification where, in addition to the normal primary specifications, a secondary density and area of application are specified. The objective of such a selection is to control the declining pressure-flow characteristic of the sprin­kler system beyond the primary design flow.

  "on is to control the declining pressure-flow characteristic of the sprin­kler system beyond the primary design flow. A case can be made for designing feed and cross mains to lower velocities than branch lines to achieve the same result as specifying a second density and area of application. B.2 .1. 3 Geometry of Area of Application (Remote Area). It is expected that, over any portion of the sprinkler system equiva­lent in size to the area of application, the system will achieve the minimum specified density for each sprinkler within that area. Where a system is computer-designed, ideally the program should verify the entire system by shifting the area of applica­tion the equivalent of one sprinkler at a time so as to cover all portions of the system. Such a complete computer verification of performance of the system is most desirable, but unfortu­nately not all available computer verification programs currently do this. This selection of the proper Hazen-Williams coefficient is important. New unlined steel pipe has a Hazen-Williams coeffi­cient close to 140. However, it quickly deteriorates to 130 and, after a few years of use, to 120. Hence, the basis for normal design is a Hazen-",

Hence, the basis for normal design is a Hazen-Williams coefficient of 120 for steel-piped wet systems. A Hazen-Williams coefficient of 100 is generally used for dry pipe systems because of the increased tendency for deposits and corrosion in these systems.

  "13-562 INSTALlATION OF SPRINKLER SYSTEMS realized that a new system will have fewer line losses than calcu­lated, and the distribution pattern will be affected accordingly. Conservatism can also be built into systems by intentionally designing to a lower Hazen-Williams coefficient than that indi­cated. B.2. 1. 4 Ability to Predict Expected Performance from Calcula­ ted Performance. Ability to accurately predict the perform­ance of a complex array of sprinklers on piping is basically a function of the pipe line velocity. The greater the velocity, the greater is the impact on difficult-to-assess pressure losses. These pressure losses are presently determined by empirical means that lose validity as velocities increase. This is especially true for fittings with unequal and more than two flowing ports. The inclusion of velocity pressures in hydraulic calculations improves the predictability of the actual sprinkler system performance. Calculations should come as close as practicable to predicting actual performance. Conservatism in design should be arrived at intentionally by known and deliberate means. It should not be left to chance. B.2. 1.5 Future Upgrading of System Performance. It",

B.2. 1.5 Future Upgrading of System Performance. It is desira­ble in some cases to build into the system the capability to achieve a higher level of sprinkler performance than needed at present. If this is to be a consideration in conservatism, consid­eration needs to be given to maintaining sprinkler operating pressures on the lower side of the optimum operating range and/ or designing for low pipeline velocities, particularly on feed and cross mains, to facilitate future reinforcement. B.3 Effect of Clearance to Ceiling on Sprinkler Performance. The problems with large clearances to ceiling were well recog­nized by the 1970s in terms of the effect both on delayed sprin­kler activation and on the effect on droplet penetration through the fire plume. The work of Alpert (19 72, 1975) , Heskestad and Delichatsios (19 79), and Beyler (19 84) clearly identified the effect of clearance to ceiling on detection and activation of sprinklers.

  "clearly identified the effect of clearance to ceiling on detection and activation of sprinklers. This was supplemented by the work of Heskestad and Smith (1976) in which the thermal responsive­ness of sprinklers was studied and modeled. Similarly, the effect of the strong plumes resulting from large clearances to ceiling and highly challenging fires was recognized in the 1970s through the work ofYao and Kalelkar (19 70), Yao (1976) , and Yao ( 1980). This understanding was reflected in the develop- ment of large drop sprinklers in the 1970s [Yao (1997) ]. The inability of \\--2 in. and 1�2 in. (12.7 mm and 13 mm) standard sprinklers to penetrate high-challenging fires was well under­stood and demonstrated in the 1970s [Yao (19 76)]. The effect of excessive clearance to ceiling was also demonstrated in the testing summarized in Annex C. This understanding of the role of clearance to ceiling on fire performance had a strong effect on the development of advanced sprinkler technologies. References: Alpert, R.

  "ANNEX C 13-563 Annex C Explanation of Test Data and Procedures for Rack Storage This annex is not a part of the requirements of this NFPA document but is included for informational purposes only. C.1 Annex C provides an explanation of the test data and procedures that led to the development of sprinkler system discharge criteria for rack storage applications. Numbers in brackets refer to paragraphs in the text. C.2 [20.3] A review of full-scale fire tests run on the standard commodity (double tri-wall carton with metal liner) , of Hall­mark products and 3M products (e.g., abrasives, pressure­sensitive tapes of plastic fiber, and paper), and of the considerable number of commodity tests conducted provides a guide for commodity classifications. Such guidance is not rela­ted to any other method of classification of materials; there­fore, sound engineering judgment and analysis of the commodity and the packaging should be used when selecting a commodity classification. C.3 [25.1 .6.4] Tests 71, 73, 81, 83, 91, 92, 95, and 100 in the 20 ft ( 6.1 m) high array involving a single level of in-rack sprin­klers were conducted without heat or water shields. Results were satisfactory. Test 115",
  "s 71, 73, 81, 83, 91, 92, 95, and 100 in the 20 ft ( 6.1 m) high array involving a single level of in-rack sprin­klers were conducted without heat or water shields. Results were satisfactory. Test 115 was conducted with two levels of sprinklers in racks with shields. Test 11 6, identical to Test 115 but without water shields, produced a lack of control. Visual observation of lower level in-rack sprinklers that did not operate although they were in the fire area indicated a need for water shields. Tests 115 and 116 were conducted to investigate the neces­sity for water shields where multiple levels of in-rack sprinklers are installed. Where water shields were not installed in Test 11 6, the fire jumped the aisle, and approximately 76 boxes were damaged. In Test 115 with water shields, the fire did not jump the aisle, and only 32 boxes were damaged. Water shields are, therefore, suggested wherever multiple levels of in-rack sprinklers are installed, except for installations with horizontal barriers or shelves that serve as water shields. C.4 [A.25.1. 4.3] The time of operation of the first sprinkler varied from 52 seconds to 3 minutes and 55 seconds, with most tests under 3 minutes,",
  "al barriers or shelves that serve as water shields. C.4 [A.25.1. 4.3] The time of operation of the first sprinkler varied from 52 seconds to 3 minutes and 55 seconds, with most tests under 3 minutes, except in Test 64 (Class III) , where the first sprinkler operated in 7 minutes and 44 seconds. Fire detection more sensitive than waterflow is, therefore, consid­ered necessary only in exceptional cases. C.5 [16.15.1 and 20.14. 1] In most tests conducted, it was necessary to use small hose for mop-up operations. Small hose was not used in the high-expansion foam test. Test 97 was conducted to evaluate the effect of dry pipe sprinkler operation. Test results were approximately the same as the base test with a wet pipe system. A study ofNFPA records, however, indicates an increase in area of operation of 30 percent to be in order for dry pipe systems as compared with wet pipe systems. C.6 [20.9.5] Tests were conducted as a part of this program with eave line windows or louvers open to simulate smoke and heat venting. These tests opened 87.5 percent and 91 percent more sprinklers than did comparative tests without windows or louvers open. Venting tests that have been conducted in other p",
  "ate smoke and heat venting. These tests opened 87.5 percent and 91 percent more sprinklers than did comparative tests without windows or louvers open. Venting tests that have been conducted in other programs were without the benefit of sprinkler protection and, as such, are not considered in this report, which covers only buildings protected by sprinklers. The design curves are based upon the absence of roof vents or draft curtains in the build­ing. During mop-up operations, ventilating systems, where installed, should be capable of manual exhaust operations. C.7 [20. 17.1. 3] No tests were conducted with idle pallets in racks using standard spray sprinklers. However, tests were conducted using ESFR and large drop sprinklers. Such storage conceivably would introduce fire severity in excess of that contemplated by protection criteria for an individual commod­ity classification. C.8 [20.19] In all valid tests with double-row racks, sprinkler water supplies were shut off at approximately 60 minutes. In only one test did the last sprinkler operate in excess of 30 minutes after ignition; the last sprinkler operated in excess of 25 minutes in three tests, with the majority of tests invol",
  "60 minutes. In only one test did the last sprinkler operate in excess of 30 minutes after ignition; the last sprinkler operated in excess of 25 minutes in three tests, with the majority of tests involving the last sprinkler operating within 20 minutes. � C.9 [25. 1.1. 2] The discharge criteria of Section 20.13 uses as a basis the large-scale fire test series conducted at the Factory Mutual Research Center, West Glocester, Rhode Island. The test building is approximately 200 ft x 250 ft (61 m x 76 m) [50,000 ft2 ( 4650 m2) in area], of fire-resistive construc­tion, and contains a volume of approximately 2.25 million ft3 (63,7 13 m3), the equivalent of a 100,000 ft2 (9230 m2) building that is 22.5 ft (6.9 m) high. The test building has two primary heights beneath a single large ceiling. The east section is 30 ft (9.1 m) high, and the west section is 60ft (18 m) high. The test series for storage height of 20 ft (6.1 m) was conducted in the 30 ft (9.1 m) section with clearances from the top of storage to the ceiling nominally 10 ft (3.0 m). Doors at the lower and intermediate levels and ventilation louvers at the tops of walls were kept closed during the majority of the fire tests, whi",
  "p of storage to the ceiling nominally 10 ft (3.0 m). Doors at the lower and intermediate levels and ventilation louvers at the tops of walls were kept closed during the majority of the fire tests, which minimized the effect of exterior condi­tions. The entire test series was fully instrumented with thermocou­ples attached to rack members, simulated building columns, bar joists, and the ceiling. Racks were constructed of steel vertical and horizontal members designed for 4000 lb (1815 kg) loads. Vertical members were 8 ft (2.4 m) on center for conventional racks and 4 ft (1. 2 m) on center for simulated automated racks. Racks were 3� ft (1 m) wide with 6 in. (150 mm) longitudinal flue space for an overall width of 7� ft (2.3 m). Simulated auto­mated racks and slave pallets were used in the main central rack in the 4 ft (1. 2 m) aisle tests. Conventional racks and conventional pallets were used in the main central rack in the 8ft (2.4 m) aisle tests. The majority of the tests were conducted with 100 ft2 (9.3 m2) sprinkler spacing. The test configuration for storage heights of 15 ft ( 4.6 m), 20 ft (6.1 m), and 25 ft (7.6 m) covered an 1800 ft2 (167.2 m2) floor area, including aisles",
  "ted with 100 ft2 (9.3 m2) sprinkler spacing. The test configuration for storage heights of 15 ft ( 4.6 m), 20 ft (6.1 m), and 25 ft (7.6 m) covered an 1800 ft2 (167.2 m2) floor area, including aisles between racks. Tests that were used in producing this standard limited fire damage to this area. The maximum water damage area anticipated in the standard is 6000 ft2 (555 m2), the upper limit of the design curves. The test data show that, as density is increased, both the extent of fire damage and sprinkler operation are reduced. The data also indicate that, with sprinklers installed in the racks, a reduction is gained in the area of fire damage and sprinkler operations (e.g., water damage).

  "13-564 INSTALlATION OF SPRINKLER SYSTEMS Table C.9 illustrates these points. The information shown in the table is taken from the test series for storage height of 20 ft (6.1 m) using the standard commodity. The fact that there is a reduction in both fire damage and area of water application as sprinkler densities are increased or where sprinklers are installed in racks should be considered carefully by those responsible for applying this standard to the rack storage situation. In the test for storage height of 25 ft (7.6 m), a density of 0.55 gpm/ft2 (22.4 mm/min) produced 42 percent, or 756 ft2 (70 m2), fire damage in the test array and a sprinkler-wetted area of 1400 ft2 (13 0 m2). Lesser densities would not be expec­ted to achieve the same limited degree of control. Therefore, if the goal of smaller areas of fire damage is to be achieved, sprin­klers in racks should be considered. The test series for storage height over 25 ft (7.6 m) was conducted in the 60 ft (18 m) section of the test building with nominal clearances from the top of storage to the ceiling of either 30 ft (9.1 m) or 10 ft (3.0 m).

  "test building with nominal clearances from the top of storage to the ceiling of either 30 ft (9.1 m) or 10 ft (3.0 m). Doors at the lower and intermediate levels and ventilation louvers at the top of walls were kept closed during the fire tests, which minimized the effect of exterior wind conditions. The purpose of the tests for storage height over 25 ft (7.6 m) was to accomplish the following: (l) Determine the arrangement of in-rack sprinklers that can be repeated as pile height increases and that provide control of the fire (2) Determine other protective arrangements, such as high­expansion foam, that provide control of the fire Control was considered to have been accomplished if the fire was unlikely to spread from the rack of origin to adjacent racks or spread beyond the length of the 25 ft (7.6 m) test rack. To aid in this judgment, control was considered to have been achieved if the fire failed to exhibit the following characteris­tics: (1) Jump the 4ft (1. 2 m) aisles to adjoining racks (2) Reach the end face of the end stacks (north or south ends) of the main rack Control is defined as holding the fire in check through the extinguishing system until the commodities initia",
  "ning racks (2) Reach the end face of the end stacks (north or south ends) of the main rack Control is defined as holding the fire in check through the extinguishing system until the commodities initially involved are consumed or until the fire is extinguished by the extin­guishing system or manual aid. The standard commodity as selected in the 20 ft (6.1 m) test series was used in the majority of tests for storage over 25 ft (7.6 m). Hallmark products and 3M products described in the 20 ft (6.1 m) test series report also were used as representative of Class III or Class IV commodities, or both, in several tests. The results of privately sponsored tests on Hallmark products and plastic encapsulated standard commodities also were made available to the committee. A 25 ft (7.6 m) long test array was used for the majority of the tests for storage over 25 ft (7.6 m). The decision to use such an array was made because it was believed that a fire in racks over 25 ft (7.6 m) high that extended the full length of a 50 ft (15 m) long rack could not be considered controlled, particu­larly as storage heights increased. One of the purposes of the tests was to determine arrange­ments of in-rack s",
  "the full length of a 50 ft (15 m) long rack could not be considered controlled, particu­larly as storage heights increased. One of the purposes of the tests was to determine arrange­ments of in-rack sprinklers that can be repeated as pile height increases and that provide control of the fire. The tests for stor­age height of 30 ft (9.1 m) explored the effect of such arrays. Many of these tests, however, produced appreciable fire spread in storage in tiers above the top level of protection within the racks. (In some cases, a total burnout of the top tiers of both the main rack and the target rack occurred.) In the case of the 30 ft (9.1 m) Hallmark Test 134 on the 60 ft (18 m) site, the material in the top tiers of storage burned vigorously, and the fire jumped the aisle above the fourth tier. The fire then burned downward into the south end of the fourth tier. In the test on the floor, a nominal 30 ft (9.1 m) clearance occurred between the top of storage and the ceiling sprinklers, whereas on the platform this clearance was reduced to nominal 10 ft (3.0 m). In most cases, the in-rack sprinklers were effective in controlling fire below the top level of protection within the racks. I",
  "reas on the platform this clearance was reduced to nominal 10 ft (3.0 m). In most cases, the in-rack sprinklers were effective in controlling fire below the top level of protection within the racks. It has been assumed by the Test Planning Committee that in an actual case with a clearance of 10 ft (3.0 m) or less above storage, ceiling sprinklers would be expected to control damage above the top level of protection within the racks. Tests have been planned to investigate lesser clearances. Tests 114 and 128 explore the effect of changing the ignition point from the in-rack standard ignition point to a face ignition location. It should be noted, however, that both of these tests were conducted with 30 ft (9.1 m) clearance from the ceiling sprinklers to the top of storage and, as such, ceiling sprinklers had little effect on the fire in the top two tiers of storage. Fire­spread in the three lower tiers is essentially the same. A similar change in the firespread where the ignition point is changed was noted in Tests 126 and 127. Once again, 30 ft (9.1 m) clear­ance occurred between the top of storage and the ceiling sprin­klers, and, as such, the ceiling sprinklers had little effect o",

Once again, 30 ft (9.1 m) clear­ance occurred between the top of storage and the ceiling sprin­klers, and, as such, the ceiling sprinklers had little effect on the face fire. Comparisons of Tests 129, 130, and 131 in the test series for storage height of 50 ft (15 m) indicate little effect of point of ignition in the particular configuration tested. Test 125, when compared with Test 133, indicates no signifi­cant difference in result between approved low-profile sprin­klers and standard sprinklers in the racks. C.10 [20.18.1] Temperatures in the test column were main­tained below 1000°F (538°C) with densities, of roof ceiling sprinklers only, of 0.375 gpm/ft2 (15 .3 mm/min) with 8 ft (2.4 m) aisles and 0.45 gpm/ft2 (18.3 mm/min) with 4 ft (1.2 m) aisles using the standard commodity. C. ll [20.19. 3. 1] Test 98 with solid shelves 24 ft (7.3 m) long and 7� ft (2.3 m) deep at each level produced total destruction of the commodity in the main rack and jumped the aisle.

Densit y from ceiling sprinklers was 0.375 gpm/ft2 (15 .3 mm/min), and rack sprinklers discharged at 15 psi (1. 0 bar). These tests did not yield sufficient information to develop a comprehensive protection standard for solid shelf racks. Items such as increased ceiling density, use of bulkheads, other configurations of sprinklers in racks, and limitation of shelf length and depth should be considered. 2022 Edition Shaded text = Revisions.

They were directly above each other and 24 ft (7.3 m) on center or 22 ft (6.7 m) on each side of the ignition flue. Ceiling sprinkler discharge density was 0.375 gpm/ft2 (15 .3 mm/min). In-rack sprinkler discharge pressure was 30 psi (2.1 bar). A total of 46 ceiling sprinklers and three in-rack sprinklers opened, and 34 percent of the commodity was consumed. The fire consumed most of the material between the in-rack sprinklers and jumped both aisles. C. 12 [20.3.3] Fire tests with open-top containers in the upper tier of storage and a portion of the third tier of storage produced an increase in sprinkler operation from 36 to 41 sprinklers and a more pronounced aisle jump and increase in firespread in the main array.

  "ge and a portion of the third tier of storage produced an increase in sprinkler operation from 36 to 41 sprinklers and a more pronounced aisle jump and increase in firespread in the main array. The smooth underside of the containers closely approximates fire behavior of slave pallets. C.13 [20.5.3.4. 1.1] Test SO was conducted to determine the effect of closing back-to-back longitudinal 6 in. (150 mm) flue spaces in conventional pallet racks. Test results indicated fewer sprinklers operating than with the flue space open, and, as such, no minimum back-to-back clearance is necessary if the transverse flue space is kept open. Tests 145 and 146 were conducted to investigate the influ­ence of longitudinal and transverse flue dimensions in double­row racks without solid shelves. Results were compared with Tests 65 and 66. Flue dimensions in Tests 65, 66, 145, and 146 were 6 in. (150 mm), 6 in. (150 mm), 3 in. (75 mm), and 12 in. (300 mm), respectively. All other conditions were the same. In Tests 65, 66, 45, and 48, sprinklers operated compared with Tests 59 and 58 for Tests 145 and 146, respectively. Fire damage in Tests 145 and 146 was somewhat less than in Tests 65 395 (37) 306 (24)",

Test results indicate narrow flue spaces of about 3 in. (75 mm) allow reasonable passage of sprinkler water down through the racks. Tests 96 and 107, on multiple-row racks, used 6 in. (150 mm) transverse flue spaces. The water demand recommended in the standard is limited to those cases with nominal 6 in. (150 mm) transverse flues in vertical alignment.

  "and Test 93, compared with Test 94, indicated a reduction in areas of application of 44.5 percent and 45.5 percent, respectively, with high-temperature-rated sprinklers as compared with ordi­nary-temperature-rated sprinklers. Other extensive Factory Mutual tests produced an average reduction of 40 percent. Design curves are based on this area reduction. In constructing the design curves, the high-temperature curves above 3600 ft2 (335 m2) of application, therefore, represent 40 percent reduc­tions in area of application of the ordinary-temperature curves in the 6000 ft2 to 10,000 ft2 (555 m2 to 930 m2) range. Test 84 indicated the number of intermediate-temperature­rated sprinklers operating is essentially the same as ordinary­temperature-rated sprinklers.

It is, therefore, not possible to determine whether lower ceiling densities should be used for aisle widths greater than 8 ft (2.4 m) or if higher densities should be used for aisle widths less than 4ft (1.2 m).

Coverage of aisles by in-rack sprinklers is, therefore, not necessary, and distribution across the tops of pallet loads at any level is not necessary for the occupancy classes tested. C.17 [25.1 .7.7] In all tests with in-rack sprinklers, obstructions measuring 3 in. x 3 ft (75 mm x 900 mm) were introduced on each side of the sprinkler approximately 3 in. (75 mm) from the sprinkler to simulate rack structure member obstruction. This obstruction had no effect on sprinkler performance in the 20 ft (6.1 m) high tests.

  "13-568 INSTALlATION OF SPRINKLER SYSTEMS C-23 [25.3.3. LL1 and 25.3.3.2. Ll] The recommended use of ordinary-temperature-rated sprinklers at ceiling for storage higher than 25 ft (7.6 m) was determined by the results of fire test data. A test with high-temperature-rated sprinklers and 0.45 gpm/ft2 (18 .3 mm/min) density resulted in fire damage in the two top tiers just within acceptable limits, with three ceil­ing sprinklers operating. A test with 0.45 gpm/ft2 (18 .3 mm/ min) density and ordinary-temperature-rated sprinklers produced a dramatic reduction in fire damage with four ceiling sprinklers operating. The four ordinary-temperature-rated ceiling sprinklers oper­ated before the first of the three high-temperature-rated ceiling sprinklers. In both tests, two in-rack sprinklers at two levels operated at approximately the same time. The high­temperature-rated sprinklers were at all times fighting a larger fire with less water than the ordinary-temperature-rated ceiling sprinklers. Tests 115 and 119 compare ceiling sprinkler density of 0.3 gpm/ft2 (12.2 mm/min) with 0.45 gpm/ft2 (18.3 mm/ min) .

  "sts 115 and 119 compare ceiling sprinkler density of 0.3 gpm/ft2 (12.2 mm/min) with 0.45 gpm/ft2 (18.3 mm/ min) . Damage patterns coupled with the number of boxes damaged in the main rack suggest that the increase in density produces improved control, particularly in the area above the top tier of in-rack sprinklers. Tests 119 and 122 compare ceiling sprinkler temperature ratings of 286°F (14 1 oq and 165°F (74°C) . A review of the number of boxes damaged and the firespread patterns indi­cates that the use of ordinary-temperature-rated ceiling sprin­klers on a rack configuration that incorporates in-rack sprinklers dramatically reduces the amount of firespread. Considering that in-rack sprinklers in the tests for storage over 25 ft (7.6 m) operated prior to ceiling sprinklers, it would seem that the installation of in-rack sprinklers converts an otherwise rapidly developing fire, from the standpoint of ceiling sprin­klers, to a slower developing fire with a lower rate of heat release. In the 20 ft (6.1 m) high test series, ceiling sprinklers oper­ated before in-rack sprinklers. In the 30 ft (9.1 m) high series, ceiling sprinklers operated after in-rack sprinklers. The 50 ft (15 m)",
  "In the 20 ft (6.1 m) high test series, ceiling sprinklers oper­ated before in-rack sprinklers. In the 30 ft (9.1 m) high series, ceiling sprinklers operated after in-rack sprinklers. The 50 ft (15 m) high test did not operate ceiling sprinklers. Ceiling sprinklers would, however, be needed if fire occurred in upper levels. The results of these tests indicate the effect of in-rack sprin­klers on storage higher than 25 ft (7.6 m). From the ceiling sprinkler operation standpoint, a fire with an expected high heat release rate was converted to a fire with a much lower heat release rate. Since the fires developed slowly and opened sprinklers at two levels in the racks, only a few ceiling sprinklers were needed to establish control. Thus, the sprinkler operating area does not vary with height for storage over 25 ft (7.6 m) or for changes in sprinkler temperature rating and density. All tests with sprinklers in racks were conducted using nomi­nal � in. (15 mm) orifice size sprinklers of ordinary tempera­ture.

The tests used quick­response, ordinary-temperature sprinklers on 15 ft x 15 ft (4.6 m x 4.6 m) spacing with an 8ft (2.4 m) high compact stor­age unit located in the middle of the sprinkler array. Results indicated a classic definition of control, the fire was held in check within the compact storage module and the fire did not jump the aisle or ignite any of the target arrays. � C.25 [26.6] In July and August of 2007, a series of three large­scale fire tests were conducted at Southwest Research Institute to investigate the effectiveness of a specific ceiling and in-rack sprinkler protection scheme dedicated for the protection of paper files in 12 in.

The storage rack for the target array in all three tests consisted of a single 50 in. (1250 mm) deep rack separated on both sides of the main array by a 30 in. (750 mm) wide aisle. Rack uprights were a nominal 3 in. (75 mm) wide. Rack bays were 120 in. (3000 mm) wide, 38 in. (950 mm) high, and equipped with perforated metal decking having a minimum of 50 percent openings. Each storage bay was provided with nine containers between uprights that was three containers deep and three containers high for a total of 81 containers per rack bay. Nomi­nal 6 in. (150 mm) wide transverse flue spaces were provided at each rack upright. Both the main array and the target array were four bays long for an overall length of 41 ft 3 in. (13 m). Open-grated (expanded) catwalks were provided in both storage aisles at the top of the third [9 ft 8 in. (2.9 m)], sixth [19 ft 2 in. (5.8 m)], and ninth [28 ft 8 in. (8.7 m)] tier levels.

A nominal 3 ft (900 mm) clearance was provided between the top of storage and the ceiling sprin­klers. The in-rack sprinkler system consisted of K-8.0 (K-115 ), 165°F (74°C) nominally rated, quick-response upright auto­matic sprinklers that were equipped with water shields and arranged to provide a constant 30 gpm (11 5 L/min) flow from each operating in-rack sprinkler. In-rack sprinklers were provi­ded within the transverse flue spaces of the main array, 2 ft (600 mm) horizontally from the face of the rack, at the top of the third and ninth tier levels on one side of the main array and at the top of the sixth tier level on the other side of the main array.

The same type of sprinklers installed within the storage racks were also installed under each catwalk and designed to provide a constant 30 gpm (11 5 L/min) flow from each operating sprinkler. These sprinklers were centered within the aisles and installed 10 ft 3 in. (3.1 m) on line. They were arranged to be aligned with the adjacent transverse flue space when the flue space was not equipped with an in-rack sprinkler; they were positioned halfway between transverse flue spaces when the adjacent flue spaces were equipped with in-rack sprinklers. In Test No. 1, ignition was at grade level at the face of the rack and centered between rack uprights.

To allow vertical fire growth directly above the point of ignition, the gap was maintained open throughout the height of the storage rack. A total of four in-rack sprinklers and one sprinkler under a catwalk operated during the test; no ceiling-level sprinklers operated. The first in-rack sprinkler to operate was located at the top of the sixth tier level at a time 3 minutes and 1 second after ignition. The second in-rack sprinkler to operate was also at the top of the sixth tier level. The last two in-rack sprinklers to operate were both located at the top of the third tier level. The fifth and final sprinkler to operate was a sprinkler located 13-569 under a catwalk at the top of the third tier level. The results of the test were considered acceptable. All three tests were considered successful and confirmed that the ceiling and in-rack sprinkler protection scheme outlined in this standard for the protection of cartoned records storage maintained in multiple-row racks with catwalk access is accepta­ble.

C.26 [20.5.3.4.2.2] During full-scale fire tests, flue space width and alignment are typically set with care for test consistency and repeatability. Some full-scale fire tests and fire experience have shown sprinkler protection designed and installed in accordance with this standard are able to tolerate random variations in flue width and vertical flue alignment. For exam­ple, see Test 7 in the National Quick Response Sprinkler Research Project: Large-Scale Test Evaluation of Early Suppression Fast-Response (ESFR) Automatic Sprinklers (report available from the NFPA Research Foundation website). For Test 7, transverse flue variations were substantial such that some flues at various tiers were completely closed (i.e., pallet loads placed immedi­ately adjacent to each other), and the vertical alignment of one transverse flue was completely disrupted. The result was the operation of eight K-14 (K-200) ESFR sprinklers as well as minor aisle jump to both target racks. Reported damage was 2� pallet loads in the main",

Reported damage was 2� pallet loads in the main rack array and � pallet load in the large racks. Findings such as Test 7 support the toleration of flue variations in the real world. However, ideally pallet loads should be positioned in racks with care to reduce the challenge faced by sprinklers should a fire occur.

  "13-570 INSTALlATION OF SPRINKLER SYSTEMS � Annex D Sprinkler System Information from the 2021 Edition of the Lif e Safety Code This annex is not a part of the requirements of this NFPA document but is included for informational purposes only. D.l Introduction. This annex is provided as an aid to the user of NFPA 13 by identifying those portions of the 2021 edition of NFPA 101 that pertain to sprinkler system design and installa­tion. It is not intended that this annex provide complete infor­mation regarding all aspects of fire protection addressed by NFPA 101. It is important to note that this information was copied from NFPA 101 but did not use NFPA's extract policy and is not intended to be a part of the requirements of NFPA 13. D.l.l The following sections cover situations where NFPA 101 provides different guidance on the design or installation of a fire sprinkler system from NFPA 13. In some cases, this differ­ent guidance is based on descriptions of unique situations handled by NFPA 101. In other cases, this different guidance stems from the different objective for NFPA 101, life safety of the occupant, rather than the property protection afforded by NFPA 13. D.l.l.l Features",

  "ANNEX E Annex E Development of the Design Approach to Conform with ASCE/ SEI 7 and Suggested Conversion Factor Adjustments for Locations Outside the United States This annex is not a part of the requirements of this NFPA document but is included for informational purposes only. � E-1 General. Seismic design of nonstructural components is governed by the provisions of Chapter 13 of ASCE/SEI 7, Mini­ mum Design Loads and Associated Criteria for Buildings and Other Structures. In ASCE/SEI 7, fire sprinkler piping is classified as a \"Designated Seismic System,\" due to its critical safety function. Design earthquake forces are multiplied by an importance factor, �' = 1.5, and both the bracing and the piping itself must be designed for seismic forces. The seismic design require­ments for the hanging and bracing of sprinkler piping systems provided in Chapter 18 of NFPA 13 presume that sprinkler piping is being constructed in the United States or in a country or jurisdictions where the seismic requirements are those speci­fied in ASCE/SEI 7. There are locations outside the United States that wish to use the seismic design requirements of Chapter 18 of NFPA 13. In Section E.3, suggested co",
  "c requirements are those speci­fied in ASCE/SEI 7. There are locations outside the United States that wish to use the seismic design requirements of Chapter 18 of NFPA 13. In Section E.3, suggested conversion factor adjustments are provided to adjust country building code design ground motion criteria to those in ASCE/SEI 7 so the procedures of Chapter 18 ofNFPA 13 can be used. The lateral sway bracing provisions of 18.5.5 were developed to allow the use of the concept of zone of influence (ZOI) , while providing designs that comply with ASCE/SEI 7. One of the main changes between the current seismic sway bracing design approach adopted in NFPA 13 and the approach used in early editions of NFPA 13 is that the spacing of the sway braces can be constrained by the flexural capacity of the pipe, as well as the capacity of the brace assembly or the capacity of the connection between the brace assembly and the supporting structure. NFPA 13 provides a design that complies with the seismic design requirements of ASCE/SEI 7 for the pipe itself. The ZOI approach yields the force demand on the bracing element and connections to the structure. Another way to look at a ZOI force is as a reactio",
  "ign requirements of ASCE/SEI 7 for the pipe itself. The ZOI approach yields the force demand on the bracing element and connections to the structure. Another way to look at a ZOI force is as a reaction in a system of continuous beams (i.e., the multiple spans of a piping system). By using conserva­tive simplifYing assumptions, a maximum ZOI force limited by the flexural capacity of the pipe can be developed for a given pipe size and span (spacing between horizontal sway braces) . The method used to develop these maximum ZOI forces is described in the following paragraphs, along with a discussion of the assumptions on the geometry of the piping system, the determination of the seismic design force coefficients, and the flexural capacity of the pipe. In the discussion that follows, the term \"main\" can be taken to mean a sprinkler main, either a feed main or a cross-main, that requires sway bracing. E-2 Assumptions on System Geometry. While every fire sprin­kler system is uniquely designed for a particular structure, there are general similarities in the layout and geometry that can be used to simplifY the design approach for earthquake protection. These similarities were used to deve",
  "d for a particular structure, there are general similarities in the layout and geometry that can be used to simplifY the design approach for earthquake protection. These similarities were used to develop assumptions on the effects of piping system continuity on the distribution of bending and shear forces in the pipe, and assumptions on spac­ing of branch lines between sway brace locations. 13-575 E.2.1 Continuity in Piping Systems. For lateral brace design purposes, piping systems can be idealized as a system of contin­uous beams. The bending moments in the sprinkler mains (the beams) were computed assuming three continuous spans, which generates the largest bending moment in any system of continuous beams. The loads generated by the branch lines are idealized as point loads. The tributary mass of the main is lumped along with the mass of the branch lines as point loads at the assumed branch line locations. E.2.2 Branch Line Locations. In many sprinkler system instal­lations, the branch lines constitute a substantial portion of the seismic mass. While there are significant variations in the spac­ing of the branch lines, their geometry is constrained by the need to provide adequate",
  "ch lines constitute a substantial portion of the seismic mass. While there are significant variations in the spac­ing of the branch lines, their geometry is constrained by the need to provide adequate water coverage, which imposes limits on the spacing of the branches. Defining a \"span\" of the main as the distance between lateral sway braces, the seismic provi­sions make the following assumptions: (1) There is a branch located at the center of the sprinkler main for spans of 25ft (7.6 m) or less. (2) There are branches at third-points of the sprinkler main for spans greater than 25 ft (7.6 m) and less than 40 ft (12 m). (3) There are branches at quarter-points of the sprinkler main for spans of 40ft (12m). It was further assumed that there is a branch line located in close proximity to each sway brace. The layout of branch lines, maximum bending moment M.nax in the pipe, and reaction R.nax (horizontal loads at sway brace locations) for sprinkler mains with spans less than 25 ft (7.6 m) is illustrated in Figure E.2.2 (a). Maximum demands for spans greater than 25 ft (7.6 m) and less than 40 ft (12 m) are given in Figure E.2.2 (b) , and for spans of 40 ft (12 m) in Figure E.2. 2(c).",

Piping systems (even when seismically braced) are considered flexible, since the funda­mental period of vibration for the system is greater than 0.06 seconds. A component response factor, Rp, of 4.5 was assumed for all piping. Finally, it was assumed that the system is installed at the roof level, h. Assume the system is laterally braced at the roof, z = h, and substitute these values into the lateral force Equation E.3b as follows: [E.3b] F, � OAffY' [ 1+2 ;; J� OA((Psr' [ 1 + 2% l= (LO) S�",

  "ANNEX E and longitude of the project site. Most countries do not base their seismic hazard maps on the ground motion criteria that USGS uses to determine the S5 values specified in ASCE/SEI 7. Instead, they might use seismic zones [similar to those in the outdated Uniform Building Code (UBC)] to convey the seismic hazard. Although different countries might use different zone identifiers, zones are often numbered with the highest number seismic zone having the strongest potential ground motions (e.g., in the UBC, Zones 0 to 4 were used, and Zone 4 had the highest seismic hazard). Although not universally true, there is often a zone factor, Z, associated with each zone that represents the peak ground acceleration based on design earthquake ground motions having a 10 percent chance of being exceeded in a 50-year period (i.e., about a 500-year return period). For these countries, a suggested correlating adjustment is S5 = 4.5 Z. The 4.5 factor is determined by multiplying the peak ground acceleration by a factor of 2.5 to convert it to peak spectral acceleration and then by a factor of 1.8 to convert design earth­quake ground motions to maximum considered earthquake ground motions, whi",

For example, for a Z factor of 0.4 (i.e., the highest value in the UBC) , the value of S5 would be 1.8, resulting in CP = 0.84 from Table 18.5.9.3. Also, for these countries, if a value of S, is needed, the value might be taken as 1.8 Z, which is the same relative relationship between the short-period and one-second spectral acceleration that was used in the 1997 UBC. The spec­tral acceleration used for seismic design is determined by Equa­tion E.3e: [E.3e] Fa is an amplification factor based on soil conditions and the intensity of ground shaking expected, measured by S5. Soil conditions are defined by site class in Table 20.3-1 of ASCE/SEI 7 and summarized in Table E.3 (a) ofNFPA 13. The values ofF;, are given in Table ll .4-1 of ASCE/SEI 7, and vary from 0.8 to 1.6. For the purposes of the zone of influence (ZOI) method, the default values of Fa are taken as the maximum tabulated values for site class A through D and are summarized in Table E.3 (b",
  "rom 0.8 to 1.6. For the purposes of the zone of influence (ZOI) method, the default values of Fa are taken as the maximum tabulated values for site class A through D and are summarized in Table E.3 (b) . By combining Equations E. 3d and E.3e, Cp can be written as shown in Equation E.3f: [E.3f] The site class can be determined by a geotechnical engineer. Additionally, the site class and seismic design category of a structure are separate pieces of information. Although both terms are classified by a letter ranging from A to F, the seismic design category determines when seismic protection is required for buildings and nonstructural elements, while the site class represents the type of soil underneath a structure and its ability to resist or absorb seismic forces. Each of these desig­nations should be determined independently in accordance with local regulations. 13-577 Table 18.5.9.3 was populated by solving for C1, for different values of S5. For example, when S5 = 1.0, the following in Equa­tion E.3g is true: [E.3g] cp = 0.467s,r;, = 0.467 {I.o )( u) = o.51 As illustrated in Figure E.3 (b) , the seismic design load, F;, includes a function of the height of the component attachment",

The most conservative seismic design load assumes the seis­mic attachment is at 100 percent of the average roof height, where z = 1.0 and h = 1.0. In this case, the function becomes a constant equal to 3.0 in accordance with Equation E.3h: 1+2 l.OO =1+2=3 .0 1.00 [E.3h] If the seismic attachment is installed at 75 percent of the average roof height, where z = 0.75 and h = 1.0, the function becomes a constant equal to 2.5 in accordance with Equation E.3i: 1+2°·75 =1 +1.5= 2.5 1.00 [E.3i] Since 2.5 is 83.3 percent of 3.0, the seismic design load for seismic attachments installed at 75 percent of the average roof height can be multiplied by a factor of 0.833. Because it might be difficult to accurately measure the average roof height of the structure relative to the grade plane, 18.5.9.3.4 of NFPA 13 assumes a multiplier of 0.875 is used.

Because it might be difficult to accurately measure the average roof height of the structure relative to the grade plane, 18.5.9.3.5 of NFPA 13 assumes a multiplier of 0. 750 is used. E.4 Flexural Capacity of Piping. The flexural capacity for different diameters and thicknesses of pipe were computed using allowable stress design (ASD). NFPA 13 has traditionally used ASD for design. While ASCE/SEI 7 generally uses the strength design (SD) approach, ASD is preferred for the design of piping systems.

SD is most appropriate when used with compact pipe sections that can develop the full limit capacity of the material, including strain hardening. Thin-wall pipes and materials without well-defined post-elastic behavior are not easily considered using SD. Permissible stresses in the pipe for seismic loading are from 13.6.7 of ASCE/SEI 7. Assuming high- or limited-deformability pipe with threaded or grooved couplings, the permissible flexu­ral stress under SD level demands is 0.7�, where � is the yield stress of the material. Since seismic design in NFPA 13 is based on ASD, the SD capacity must be reduced to an ASD level. The permissible flexural stress for ASD is determined by adjusting the SD level flexural capacity. The SD capacity is first reduced by a load factor to ASD levels, and then can be increased by the allowable stress increase for seismic loading.

The installation is in a region of high seismicity, and based on the latitude and longitude of the build­ing site, S5 = 1. 75. To calculate the seismic load, use Table 18.5.9.3 to deter­mine the seismic coefficient, Cr The value of S, = 1.75 coordi­nates to 0.82. The horizontal force on the brace, from 18.5.6.3, is [E.5b] F;,, = c\"�' = o.82 (960) = 787 lb From Table 18.5.5.2 (a), the maximum ZOI load, F;''\"' for a 4 in. Schedule 10 pipe spanning 20 ft (6.1 m) is 1634 lb (740 kg), which is larger than the calculated demand of 787 lb (355 kg). The 4 in. (100 mm) Schedule 10 pipe is adequate for the seismic load and a brace would be selected with a minimum capacity of 787 lb (355 kg). If the sway brace was attached to the 2 in. (50 mm) Schedule 40 pipe, the ZOI demand Fp'\" of 787 lb (355 kg) would be compared to the maximum capacity for a 2 in. (50 mm) Sched­ule 40 pipe found in Table 18.5.5.2 (c) and Table 18.5.5.2 (d) .

For a 20 ft (6.1 m) span, this is 520 lb (236 kg), less than the demand of 787 lb (355 kg). A 2 in. (50 mm) pipe would be inadequate, and a sway brace would have to be added to reduce the ZOI demand, or the system pipe size increased. E.6 Limitations of the ZOI Method. The ZOI approach can be used for a variety of piping materials. There are, however, important limitations of which the designer should be aware. The first is that the appropriate component response factor, �\" must be used. To select the proper value, the piping systems must be classified as high-, limited-, or low-deformability. Defi­nitions of these terms are given in Section 11 .2 of ASCE/SEI 7. The second major assumption is that the flexural behavior of the pipe is not governed by local buckling of the pipe wall. For steel pipe, this can be achieved by observing the thickness to diameter limits given in the AlSC Specifications for the Design, Fabrication, and Erection of Structural Steel Buildings. Establishing the local buckling characteristics of pipe fabricated from other materials can requir",
  "n in the AlSC Specifications for the Design, Fabrication, and Erection of Structural Steel Buildings. Establishing the local buckling characteristics of pipe fabricated from other materials can require testing. The tables for the maximum load, Fp,, in zone of influence are based on common configurations of mains and branch lines. There can be cases where the actual configuration of the piping system could generate higher stresses in the piping than assumed in the tables. For example, a main braced at 40 ft (12.2 m) intervals, with a single branch line in the center of the span, can have a smaller maximum load capacity, Fi\"\"' than the tabulated value. Where the configuration of the mains and branch lines vary significantly from the assumed layout, the pipe stresses should be checked by engineering analysis.

  "ANNEX E 13-581 K 7-2 Calculation for Maximum Load Capacity of Concrete Anchors. This example shows how the effects of prying and brace angle are calculated when using Table E.7 (a). � E-7.2 .1 Procedure. Step 1. Determine the allowable seismic tension value (Tallow) and the allowable seismic shear value ( Yatwwl for the anchor, based on data found in the anchor manufacturer's approved evaluation report. Note that, in this example, it is assumed the evaluation report provides the allow­able tension and shear capacities. If this is not the case, the strength design anchor capacities must be determined using the procedures in Chapter 17 of ACI 318, which are then converted to ASD values by dividing by a factor of 1.4. As an alternative to calculating the allowable seismic tension value ( Tauowl and the allowable seismic shear value ( V,,uawl for the anchor, the seismic tension and shear values that were used to calculate Figure 18.5.12.1 for anchor allowable load tables can be used.

  "Concrete and Masonry Industry Firesafety Committee 5420 Old Orchard Road, Skokie, Illinois 60077 Position Paper and Information Sheet on NFPA 13R: Installation of Sprinkler Systems in Residential Occupancies up to Four Stories in Height Position: Responsible use of sprinkler systems designed and installed within the scope and intent of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 13R sprinkler standard, will lead to improved firesafety conditions in multifamily housing. The concrete and masonry industry supports this activity, but strongly opposes revisions to building code provisions that encourage the installation of 13R systems at the ex­ pense of sacrificing other proven fire-protection fea­ tures such as compartmentation, detection, noncombustible construction, and structural fire re­ sistance. Introduction and Background The development and release of NFPA Standard 13R : Installation of Sprinkler Systems in Residential Oc­ cupancies up to Four Stories in Height has virtually coincided with the actions of model code organiza­ tions to mandate sprinklers in low-rise multifamily, and hotel or motel buildings.

  "oincided with the actions of model code organiza­ tions to mandate sprinklers in low-rise multifamily, and hotel or motel buildings. Through NFPA's adoption of the standard in November 1988, an economical means of satisfying this mandate was created. Affor­ dability was addressed by permitting certain areas within the building to remain unsprinklered and by allowing a reduced water demand from that which would normally be required by NFPA 13. NFPA 's justification for omitting sprinklers in certain areas was based on data indicating that the percentage of deaths and injuries resulting from fires originating in these areas was small compared to the total. Scope of the 13R Standard Sprinkler systems designed and installed in accord­ ance with NFPA 13R are intended for residential oc­ cupancy buildings no more than four stories in height. Residential occupancies are defined in the standard as apartment buildings; lodging and rooming houses; hotels, motels, and dormitories; prompt-evacuation board-and-care facilities; and board-and-care facilities with 16 or fewer occupants of the slower evacuation type. In cases where dwelling units are located in occupancies classified as other than",
  "on board-and-care facilities; and board-and-care facilities with 16 or fewer occupants of the slower evacuation type. In cases where dwelling units are located in occupancies classified as other than residential, sprinklers shall be installed per NFPA 13. Appropriateness of Tradeoffs with 13R Installations With the arrival of the 13R sprinkler standard onto the codes scene, traditional tradeoffs that have been permitted for NFPA 13 sprinkler systems should be reviewed to determine if they are suitable for 13R sprinkler installations. Trading off code features that are primarily intended to provide property protection should not be permitted w ith 13R installations. Some examples of inappropriate tradeoffs are Increases in allowable building height Allowmg the use of 13R systems in residential build­ ings more than four stories in height, which is beyond the scope of the 13R standard Area increases resulting in larger building areas; fewer or no firewa!ls or area separation walls Reducing draft-stopping protection of combustible concealed spaces by increasing minimum spacing requirements (even though sprinklers are not required in these spaces by the 13R standard) Reducing the struc",
  "ng draft-stopping protection of combustible concealed spaces by increasing minimum spacing requirements (even though sprinklers are not required in these spaces by the 13R standard) Reducing the structural fire resistance of corridors, stair enclosures, exterior walls, and floor or ceiling assemblies and walls constructed as tenant separa­ tions Areas of Coverage NFPA 13R specifies that sprinklers be installed in all areas, with four significant exceptions. Areas not requiring sprinklers include • Bathrooms that do not exceed 55 sq ft in floor-area, that have noncombustible plumbing fixtures • Closets where the smallest dimension does not ex­ ceed 3 feet, and the floor area does not exceed 24 sq ft, and the walls and ceilings are surfaced with noncombustible or limited combustible materials BIA Brick Institute of America NCMA National Concrete Masonry Association PCA Portland Cement Association ESCSI Expanded Shale, Clay and Slate Institute NRMCA National Ready Mixed Concrete Association PCI Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute",
  "•Open, attached porches, balconies, corridors, and stairs • Attics, penthouse equipment rooms, crawl spaces, elevator shafts, and other concealed spaces that are not used or intended for use as living or storage space Although the impact of allowing these unsprinklered areas may seem insignificant at first, this really isn't the case. For example, bathrooms and closets are typically located adjacent to dwelling-unit separation walls in multifamily dwellings. If the fire resistance of the wall is reduced, this may result in two contiguous, nonsprinklered rooms or areas in different tenant spaces, separated by a wall offering only one-half the fire resistance required in nonsprinklered buildings. Even more serious is the omission of sprinklers from combustible concealed spaces in conjunction with tradeoffs. Fires originating in such spaces may go undetected for a considerable period of time, thus affo:ding the fire an opportunity to spread laterally or vert1cally to remote areas. According to NFPA statis­ tics, these fires cause a disproportionately higher amount of property damage than fires originating in areas that are normally occupied.

  "ng to NFPA statis­ tics, these fires cause a disproportionately higher amount of property damage than fires originating in areas that are normally occupied. Lack of sprinkler coverage of open, attached por­ ches, balconies, corridors, and stairs is also a con­ cern, since multifamily occupancies are generally more susceptible to arson and outdoor cooking fires than other occupancies. Reducing the fire resistance of exterior walls or balconies can only increase the extent of property damage caused by these incidents and other exterior-origin fires. All these scenarios strike at the heart of the fun­ damental sprinkler tradeoff issue; that is, tradeoffs pertaining to property protection should not be per­ mitted with partial sprinkler systems such as 13R. Arguments Against Property-Protection Tradeoffs with 13R Installations 1. The 13R standard already represents a tradeoff since it evolved primarily as a means of providing an affordable lifesafety sprinkler system in multi­ family buildings. Affordability issues are addressed mainly through reductions in water supply and sprinkler coverage requirements, as compared to NFPA 13 systems. Because the 13R system is a partial system, it d",
  "ings. Affordability issues are addressed mainly through reductions in water supply and sprinkler coverage requirements, as compared to NFPA 13 systems. Because the 13R system is a partial system, it does not warrant the same type of tradeoffs that have traditionally been permitted with full coverage NFPA 13 installations. 2. The 13R system is essentially a lifesafety system When the standard was first developed, sprinklers were targeted for specific areas, based on the impact that fires originating in those areas had on lifesafety. Commentary in the 13R Appendix states \"the standard is designed to provide a high, but not absolute, level of lifesafety and a lesser level of property protection.\" 3. While fires originating in areas not required to be sprinklered under 13R account for only 8.5% of the injuries and 5.6% of the fire deaths in multifamily d:\"'ellings, they account for a disproportionately h1gh amount of property damage. NFPA statistics reveal that these same fires (14.9% in number) are responsible for 23.1% of the total dollar losses from all fires in multifamily buildings. 4. Residential sprinklers are \"listed\" based on their ability to provide appropriate lifesafety pro",
  "umber) are responsible for 23.1% of the total dollar losses from all fires in multifamily buildings. 4. Residential sprinklers are \"listed\" based on their ability to provide appropriate lifesafety protection when tested against a limited number of reasonably severe fire scenarios. However, the 13R Appendix indicates that 13R systems may not be expected to control a fire involving fuel loads higher than 10 pounds per square foot (psf) of floor area. Studies conducted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)* have shown that the mean fire load in single-family dwellings is 13 psf. It follows that the fire load in multifamily dwellings should be equal or even greater than this, due to the tendency toward smaller room sizes. 5. Residential sprinklers installed in dwelling units are designed for lifesafety purposes. Standard spri.nkler heads, as required by NFPA 13, are des1gned for property protection. While neither type is 100% effective, most of the statistical data to date regarding sprinkler-system performance has been based on the experiences of standard sprinkler heads installed in industrial and commer­ cial applications (NFPA 13 systems). The 13R sys­ tem is",
  "o date regarding sprinkler-system performance has been based on the experiences of standard sprinkler heads installed in industrial and commer­ cial applications (NFPA 13 systems). The 13R sys­ tem is intended for an occupancy that has not typically been sprinklered. The lack of a formal !nspecti~n and m~intenance program, as is usually 1n place 1n 1ndustnal and commercial occupancies, could be significantly detrimental to the perfor­ mance record of the 13R system. It is inappropriate to predict the effectiveness of residential sprinkler systems based on the past performances of the more traditional NFPA 13 sprinkler systems. Conclusions Evidence has been presented that shows the NFPA 13R sprinkler standard is truly lifesafety oriented. For this reason and because 13R systems only provide partial sprinkler coverage, tradeoffs that may com­ promise property protection are unjustified. The con­ crete and masonry industry does not oppose building code provisions that permit the use of 13R systems, as long as the installations comply with the scope and intent of the standard and no tradeoffs of property­ protection features are granted. *lss;:m, L.A., .\"Single-Family Residential Fire",
